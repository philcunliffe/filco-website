# Hyperparam Chat Tool Registry
---

## Features
1. The page should be able to define tools which will be accessible to the chat window. This should let us genericize the chat component which can pull it's prompt and even it's tools from the page itself.
2. Ollama compat via env variables? 
## Playground
- Global entity that allows registration of tools and sets the prompt
- Could make the whole thing a lot easier to log and test centrally
-
