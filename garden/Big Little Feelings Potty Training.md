# Big Little Feelings Potty Training
---

- Not potty "training", potty "learning"
	- When they mess up don't get stressed, just like I wouldn't with ABC's
	- Keeps the correct perspective
- Steps
	- What it feels like
	- How to hold it
	- How to get undressed
	- How to sit
	- How to let it go
- It's a process, setbacks and accidents are ok
- Toddler's don't want to be told in a stressful voice
- Toddler's will respond to a calm confident teacher

## 3 C's
- Be committed
- Stay consistent
- Play it cool
- 3 day timeline
- The goal of PL is to connect the feeling of needing to P&P with the action of getting on a potty
- Block off 3 days
	- No activities
- Biggest mistake is not "committing"
	- This inconsistently really confuses the toddler
	- Toddler brain is currently growing in overdrive
		- They are using their brain to sort through a lot of things
		- Consistency eases this
	- Stick with the same method no matter what
	- Watch when they start and then rush them to the potty
- Reward training doesn't work as well
- PLAY IT COOL
	- Can't force it like you can other things
		- The more you push the more they resist
			- Really need to chill on the food stuff
		- Toddler's see it as a battle for control
		- Pressure can't come in a lot of forms
			- Negotiation
			- Over the top phrase
			- Comparison
			- Asking a million times
			- All will result in no
	- Pressure free zone
	- How:
		- Calm confident energy
		- Mantras can help, "this is my toddler's body, not mine, he'll figure it out"
		- Deep breaths, "listen to your potty"
		- Relax your body language
		- You can be upbeat without being hyped up
		- Accident
			- "You peed on the floor, pee goes in the potty"
		- Need them to be able to look inward, not outward
## 2.1 PREP Yourself
- Trigger 1: Mess and dirt
	- I am not great with liquids on couch on rug
	- Remember - "This mess is temporary"
- Trigger 2: Control
	- I do have some of this with things when I don't think people are doing things the right way
	- Need to control this so I don't accidently create pressure
- Trigger 3: Mistake
	- I'm bad about this, I want to correct really badly, though I've gotten a lot better
	- Child having an accident is not a "mistake"
		- Will help child understand that he doesn't like the pee on his legs
		- They are opportunities to try again
		- They aren't failing, they're learning
		- Try not to say "It's OK"
			- Calm - "You peed on the floor, pee goes in the potty"
- Trigger 4: Comparison
	- Shouldn't be a problem for me
- Comfy clothes
- Have some beer ready for end of the day
- 

## 3.2 Go Naked
- 4 Steps
	- 1. Watch for cues
	- 2. Help them get to the potty and encourage them to let it out
	- 3. Acknowledge their effort
	- 4. Casually prompt every 30 minutes and remind where potty is
- 1st thing when we wake up:
	- Today we're saying bye bye to your diapers, pee and poop go in the potty
	- We won't wear clothes today
- Show them where the potty will be
- Watch like a hawk for signs
	- Starting to pee
		- You're peeing, let's go sit on the potty
	- Might hold their privates
	- Crossing legs
	- Potty dance
	- Shivering
	- Staring into space
- If there's even a single drop in the potty
	- Treat it as a win
	- "You did it, you felt the pee and you went and sat on the potty, it feels so good to pee on the potty huh?"
- No drops
	- "You didn't make it this time, next time you feel the pee down here go to the potty and let it out"
	- "Thank you for sitting and trying"
- If you see a sign say "It looks like you need to use the potty, let's go sit on the potty"k
- Pre-poop signs
	- Passing gas
	- squirming
	- move to a quiet space
- Empower them to listen to their body
	- "Ok, when you feel the poop down here go to the potty and let it slide out"
- Let them put the poop in the big toilet and flush it down
