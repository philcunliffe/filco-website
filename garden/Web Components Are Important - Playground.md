# Web Components Are Important - Playground

I want to talk about a feature of web components that I have never seen mentioned and is what I believe sets them apart from compiled frameworks, and that's their *uncompiled* nature.

Before you comment, yes, I'm aware that the best and easiest way to write web components is by using compiled frameworks like Lit and Stencil, but that's not what I mean when I say they are "uncompiled." I mean that applications built using web components can be composed and configured in an uncompiled HTML file and so are *composable at runtime*.

## Composability at Runtime

This metaphor may be a bit stretched, but bear with me: imagine buying a Lego pirate ship. It's meticulously designed to come together as a cohesive whole. Each small piece, like cannons, is custom-fabricated to contribute to the final product. This is how I view compiled frameworks. While you might be able to reuse those cannons from a medieval battle set, they will always be part of a "compiled" product (or application) when sold.

Web component frameworks *can* be like selling a collection of pieces, allowing users to assemble them however they choose, even if they arenâ€™t master Lego builders. Just as Lego pieces have universally sized studs to connect seamlessly, web components use the familiar mechanisms of a standard HTML element. This allows developers to encapsulate complex applications within a web component, enabling other pieces to connect through a straightforward interface.

- Writing web-components can be seen as extending HTML itself instead

Applications made from web components can be easily composed in a simple HTML file with minimal guidance, making it accessible to anyone without domain expertise. The combination of encapsulated application-like components with runtime composability empowers users to create very powerful applications with zero JavaScript knowledge.
