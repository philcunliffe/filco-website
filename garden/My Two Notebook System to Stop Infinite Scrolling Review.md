# My Two Notebook System to Stop Infinite Scrolling Review
---

## Why did I watch?

The video premise is so close to what I have been implementing / using in my life that I watched to compare techniques and maybe steal some.
## Thoughts and ideas
He begins by going through the schpeal of why using analog tools can be good. I particularly resonated with his point about how daily tracking can make journals un-fun and keeping a larger journal to life tracking and planning only works better. This is something I have noticed in my own practice and I believe it's the source of some of my journaling lulls.

*"It doesn’t matter what’s going on in my life, how busy I am, or how overwhelmed I might be with work. I can always go to my journal, capture what I’m thinking, and formulate a plan for the future"*

This is also a salient point for me though my ability to use this method is much more limited because of my time constraints. Later he says:

*"Anytime I felt less motivated, I would just go back to that entry and read how motivated I was and how much I didn’t want to go back to what I was doing at the time"*

This is a technique I've used with an iPhone note that I have automated to pop up at 6:30 every morning. Converting this to a physical note and then finding some way to indicate a trail of crumbs for me to follow through my various essential goals could be highly effective. I'll need to concoct a way to lead myself through important physical notes, or maybe gather important snippets on a single page?

*"So, on the top, I write down the date and day, and I write down three things I want to get done for that day. Those three things are the most important things I need to get done. Below that, I'll have less important tasks, errands, and habits I want to get to."*

This is a technique I will be stealing. In my to-do tracking, I don't separate by priority, which leads me to execute the easiest tasks and ignore the most impactful ones.

Lastly, he mentions using digital tools but propagating essential things to his physical journal for longevity and context. The longevity has obvious benefits, but what interests me is the idea of providing context around habit and highlight tracking. I write this while smack dab in the middle of caring for a newborn and potty training a toddler, believe it or not, I'm not crushing my habits. I believe that keeping track of my average sleep score each week in my journal would provide future me with valuable context. It would help prevent the negative self-talk that often arises when I notice patterns of unhealthy habits.
