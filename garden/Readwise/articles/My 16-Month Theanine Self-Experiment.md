# My 16-Month Theanine Self-Experiment

## Highlights
- Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter [glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter)) (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp1a46de5seb8z03n23kg6xg))
- For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp1a594w29t5nf2z126k4nnc))

- My stress level *did* usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was *terrible* at guessing what I’d taken. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jp1akfd14sbsmbeqjq2kct1d))
