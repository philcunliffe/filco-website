# Why I’m Skeptical of Rewriting JavaScript Tools in “Faster” Languages

![rw-book-cover](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/images/article3.5c705a01b476.png)

## Highlights
- for a long time, the JavaScript tooling ecosystem has been focused on building something that *works*, not something fast. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbhztr6e1063w8449687skfb))
- Furthermore, if a function is "hot" (frequently executed), it will be further optimized into machine code. This is the JIT in action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbj0qv9y82zfxw7fs080kw3c))
- Thanks to the inimitable [Joyee Cheung](https://nolanwlawson.wordpress.com?action=user_content_redirect&uuid=2c2520ae4098c9120a3afd86542241bfe2780b047ad73c7563540b305424f9b1&blog_id=21720966&post_id=14552&user_id=257213848&subs_id=746625189&signature=6b1f2ac6aca19036444ad6bfee3dccdf&email_name=new-post&user_email=filcofeed@feed.readwise.io&encoded_url=aHR0cHM6Ly9qb3llZWNoZXVuZy5naXRodWIuaW8vYmxvZy9hYm91dC8), though, Node is now getting a [compile cache](https://nolanwlawson.wordpress.com?action=user_content_redirect&uuid=18b073016f09b004a0870c150a9243e151a67153f5f568eed19d29acdafdaf09&blog_id=21720966&post_id=14552&user_id=257213848&subs_id=746625189&signature=805f2b316145bd9b33b6f08c299bfd1d&email_name=new-post&user_email=filcofeed@feed.readwise.io&encoded_url=aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL25vZGVqcy9ub2RlL3B1bGwvNTI1MzU).

- In the meantime, though, JIT is still a case where native languages have an edge on JavaScript. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbj0sxt39npkqh7zsmemqq9p))
- JavaScript is, in my opinion, a working-class language. It's very forgiving of types (this is one reason I'm not a huge TypeScript fan) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbj0tz002vpsnjr03t8nngaz))
- To quote [Matteo Collina](https://nolanwlawson.wordpress.com?action=user_content_redirect&uuid=eec5dc9ef1c38267450b1c510f2f88b3b1eff897bd899bbeb75229d1fdc345cf&blog_id=21720966&post_id=14552&user_id=257213848&subs_id=746625189&signature=efe7ac9b5221d423c005268d467ae642&email_name=new-post&user_email=filcofeed@feed.readwise.io&encoded_url=aHR0cHM6Ly9mb3NzdG9kb24ub3JnL0BtY29sbGluYS8xMTI3MjM0NTA5NjM4NTExMTY):
  > Most developers ignore the fact that they have the skills to debug/fix/modify their dependencies. They are not maintained by unknown demigods but by fellow developers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jbj0vz7rwbgx0smbpa3zg5qj))
- I can imagine the average JavaScript developer feeling completely hopeless every time there's a bug in one of their build tools. Rather than empowering the next generation of web developers to achieve more, we might be training them for a career of learned helplessness.
