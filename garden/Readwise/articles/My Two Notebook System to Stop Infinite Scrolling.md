## Highlights
- You don't need to set a daily habit to journal for 10 minutes a day. What you can do is simply track your habits, highlights, and just reflect on it whenever you have an inspiration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgtbzg10yp76wp675x6pfy6))
- 'll be inspired by listening to a podcast or having a conversation with somebody, and I'll want to think about it more or capture an idea that I have in my journal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgte6ggtvn1jj9evz4ypa2s))
- It doesn’t matter what’s going on in my life, how busy I am, or how overwhelmed I might be with work. I can always go to my journal, capture what I’m thinking, and formulate a plan for the future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgthma0ep1xjwrfr1e8bc0m))

- So, on the top, I write down the date and day, and I write down three things I want to get done for that day.
  Those three things are the most important things I need to get done. Below that, I'll have less important tasks, errands, and habits I want to get to. For me, the separation is really important because it makes it obvious what are actually the most important things to get done that day. When I just look at a big list of to-dos in my to-do app, it doesn't really prioritize what the most important things are. And if I just work off of that, I might choose the easiest things, which are not the most impactful things I can work on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgtwj32s7x5yec8ta3mxfd7))
- might write down my average sleep score.
  For the week or month in my monthly page. The reason why I write down the data I care about into my journal is first, it gives a context around the other entries and habits I'm tracking in my journal, but second, my journal is going to outlive my phone or any app that I'm using ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtgv06992vd9kn8g95dz4fm7))
