# Write about ADD and self-reflection

I'm coming to realize I misunderstood why I wanted to do things like brew beer. That particular hobby was about the friendship and when the friendship died the hobby died. I think this type of self reflection and what I'm writing in [[Should I Get a 3D Printer]] can help combat incomplete-projectitis.

It reminds me a bit of what the ADHDM does
