# 2025 Goals
---
I want to keep my spaces tidy by reducing my stuff and establishing habits. A dirty space gives me a base level of anxiety and distracts me from being productive.

I want to stretch or do yoga every day by making it part of a morning routine. As I get older my body is less resilient and I want to mitigate that as much as possible so I can be as active as I can with my kids.

I want to maintain a more consistent sleep schedule and morning routine where I wake up significantly before my kids. When I wake up with them I am always playing catch up. My evening hours are mostly wasted on YouTube, I’m staying up on the off chance I get to game with my friends.

I want to play my game with my friends and have everyone enjoy it. I will do this by dedicating time every week to work on it exclusively. I love board games and think I can make a game that people will really enjoy.

I want to design and maintain a [[Life Organization System]]. I’ll do this by researching and taking pieces that I find valuable. I get too caught in the minutiae and need a system to see the big picture.

I want to write more, particularly in my garden. Even this exercise has me wanting to split off new docs with ideas for each goal. It helps me refocus on my current goals. I will do this by spending part of my morning with obsidian.

I want to keep my hair and beard groomed weekly. I’ll do this by setting aside time in the morning every weekend. When I’m groomed i feel more comfortable and confident which affects everything else.
