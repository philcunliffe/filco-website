# Sci-fi Racing
---
## Ideas
- Two phases
	- Deck building
	- The race
- Deck building would be powers triggered by dice values
- Race would be rolling dice over and over until someone wins
	- Maybe 2 dice?
- Player card will have 6 slots, one for each dice value which all start with a simple move forward 1
	- Should each number be a deck that rotates?
- Something allows for 2 dice rolls to be joined?
- Track is made up from cards that are flipped when the first / last player gets there and affects the race somehow
- During the race, players can divert power by guessing what number is going to come up, if they get it right then the power is increased
- Budget for cards determined by how many races they want to do
- Certain amount of cards are laid out before each race and players can auction style bid to buy the cards
	- Some number of cards / player
- 

## Ship card brainstorming
- Different move values
- Weapons
- Shields
- Traps
## Track cards brainstorming
- Simple move up / back
- Roll another dice
- Roll a bad dice
## Feeling

- Last minute lead changes
- Fast-paced
## Inspiration
