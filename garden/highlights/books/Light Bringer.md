# Light Bringer

![rw-book-cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NlFOSxr9L._SY160.jpg)

## Highlights
- Inside me there is a coward who fears discomfort. That coward will offer solace in the form of excuses. But it is the coward who grooms a man for his defeats. The coward who makes him accept them because he is accustomed to finding a good reason to quit. The coward inside can only be killed one way.
