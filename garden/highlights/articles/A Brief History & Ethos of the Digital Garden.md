# A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden

## Highlights
- They're not following the conventions of the "*personal blog*," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j81nw5v9754gdp08v7qya973))
- A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j81nwh4hd75temqkpd8211qb))
- They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j81nwvhfvjchmfxxy6qydqq5))
- The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments.[](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/#footnote-3) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9vkc5b1ft2njsk3r802spgj))
- Gardens are organised around **contextual relationships and associative links**; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9y0s6sje02myqapev3cr81k))
- there is no "final version” on a garden ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9y1pajwc8bfd4tzagxvq7fh))
- Think of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our *chaos streams* - a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books that you prune and tend for years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9y29tbv24r1zjak84k0rqaa))
- their posts, indicating both their certainty level about the material, and how much effort went into making it. They also make a strong case for [lazy epistemic statuses](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing) as a feature, not a bug. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0m2v8ph4mrfmyy5ajmkah3))
- The point of a garden is that it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0m1heat15qhnvvpt5qcjhw))
- Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social spaces is a shit show. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0m46c8kqrdwcf87zr8vj8w))
- We know nothing of their lives, backgrounds, or belief systems, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0m4r38031t2p28jeh023kz))
- Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0m6j7sb3wsgrjkr7cmadhz))
- This patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or Medium. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0mp69nz1pkjysk5m59g8rk))
- You should think about how you want your space to grow over the next few decades, not just the next few months. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja0pgv461ay7shm2rv1j1gjb))
