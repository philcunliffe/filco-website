## Highlights
- This week we explore the use of theme vs. mechanisms in games ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja5s5ckht3sbq6src3qgerej))
- Mechanics are the various actions, behaviors and control mechanisms afforded to the player within a game context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja5s6958b75c669r0v1m268t))
- **Theme encompasses the setting, story, and tone or mood of a game.** It is expressed via illustration, components, mechanisms, and narrative descriptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja5s6ztyaw7z8ghb6btsqzmc))
- A game’s theme can feel “pasted on” when the theme has minimal connections to the actual gameplay.
  This isn’t always a bad thing, however, as shown by games like [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja5s8qse4qr5yz15gn84fczh))
- The opposite of a “pasted on” theme is a “thematic game.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hda6gvjpyxy78pmmvhzvg))
- Roleplaying is encouraged and comes naturally, sometimes causing players to [make suboptimal choices](https://www.skeletoncodemachine.com/p/call-to-adventure). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hdnjbjb5twdc630msqdc3))
- Core gameplay is a series of rules and mechanisms that produce an experience even when divorced from theme. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hexw5d1xhkbcw4vtag6en))
- Baked-in thematic elements are those that cannot be avoided when playing a game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hgj77wmkb53e3b8415bve))
- including illustration, components, icons, graphics, layout, and terminology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hgsefjwepjqnzps4nx9b0))
- Opt-in thematic elements are those that can be ignored during gameplay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hhwc98zydhmnwy9zw63d6))
- Long descriptions of game lore, reading narration, and flavor text on cards are all examples of opt-in elements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6hj58sygemj6y0td0sqznk))
