# Web Components Are Okay

## Highlights
- This is completely true. If your goal is to build the absolute fastest framework you can, then you want to minimize DOM nodes wherever possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagk5gj2hg0vb77nnv7ggdbg))
- There are other tradeoffs in software development, such as maintainability, security, usability, and accessibility. Sometimes these things come into conflict. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagk6ccesxbtgm26tnab9bvm))
- Having worked for a long time in the web performance space, I find that the lowest-hanging fruit for performance is usually something dumb like [layout thrashing](https://web.dev/articles/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing), network waterfalls, unnecessary re-renders, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagk8wa1stcjajb4mkeepn64))
- *Outputting* web components is indeed painful, but hey – nobody said you have to do it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagkax7ay2mdd7zbhz9s2548))
- Furthermore, I get the impression that a wide swath of the web development community does not care about web components, does not want to support them, and you probably couldn’t convince them to. And that’s okay! T ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagkcbf1d4jjev5j75d1dgdw))
- Component authors must decide whether [their `<slot>`s should work like native `<slot>`s](https://dev.to/richharris/why-i-don-t-use-web-components-2cia). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagkg6w814btqpt6dbxp40wx))
- That’s fine! At least we have a common point of reference, a shared vocabulary to compare and contrast things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagkggx1h28vgqatxfq9e4jk))
- but for now, there are still cases where React, Solid, Svelte, and friends shine and web components flounder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagkjctfah9ey0cp86f76r5f))
- people are talking past each other because they’re building different things with different constraints ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jagkka3hvcga3j3t6jam0vmg))
