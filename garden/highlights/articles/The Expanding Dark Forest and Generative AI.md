# The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI

![rw-book-cover](https://maggieappleton.com/og.png)

## Highlights
- The [dark forest theory](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web) of the web points to the increasingly life-like but life-less state of being online.[](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest/#footnote-1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6fzb8k5gn9rm7a1g1s1n7g))
- It's like a dark forest that seems eerily devoid of human life – all the living creatures are hidden beneath the ground or up in trees. If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6fzxyp163fwcmejsb87360))
- have to hide in closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Or make themselves [illegible](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g0a4yxvxpa74pprxz188c))
- That dark forest is about to expand. Large Language Models (LLMs) that can instantly generate coherent swaths of human-like text have just joined the party. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g0w884bwkj5g8bhwzrqky))
- Marketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up [OpenAI → Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations) pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g1rbb580rdh5ajmkdkqmc))
- We're about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g29wk71epagtbnjgsyy0x))
- Our new challenge as little snowflake humans will be to prove we aren't language models. It's the reverse [turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g3k5k6m3g25g1gzt5ajcy))
- What special human tricks can you do that a language model can't? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g4b2t51jtnqrzw8seq2t4))
- They do not have beliefs based on evidence, claims, and principles. They cannot consult external sources and run experiments against objective reality. They cannot go outside and touch grass. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g52pgbm6emc66rv0zk22c))
- In short, they do not have access to the same shared reality we do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g5n66kfz02cp69zp0gt7q))
- We can, so to speak, “triangulate” on objective reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g6qp6wzc0y380gfh4hfkj))
- In a repulsively evocative metaphor, they engage in “[human centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Centipede_(First_Sequence)) epistemology.”[7](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest/#footnote-7) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ja6g8tymgy1xhkfk9xq45p5b))
- This all sounds a bit rough, but there's a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We'll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans. When a machine can pump out a great literature review or summary of existing work, there's no value in a person doing it.

- No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we'll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.

- We might see increased [fetishisation](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/#:~:text=a%20resurgence%20and%20even%20fetishization%20of%20explicitly%20%22offline%22%20culture%2C%20where%20the%20%22Great%20Logging%20Off%22%20becomes%20literal) of anti-screen culture, as well as [real estate](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/#:~:text=Seventh%2C%20real,amenities%20are%20available) price increases in densely populated areas.
