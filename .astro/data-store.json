He’s constantly looking at me to help him define himself. Each mimicry or parody he presents back to me brings me great joy and a sense of responsibility. My role makes me the prototype and whenever I think about that I feel an undeniable urge to create an idealized version of myself—someone he can look up to, someone he can use as a template.\n\nYet, that urge is complicated. On the one hand, striving to be a better version of myself for him is the most powerful motivation I've ever felt. It pushes me to confront parts of my life I’ve neglected or let slide—how I treat my body, my habits, and my responsibilities around the house. However, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking I need to be perfect, which is an unattainable ideal that could lead to frustration or a sense of failure. It's possible that by trying too hard, I could push him away from the very things I want him to value.\n\n#### What I Want to Teach Him\n\nThere are so many lessons I want to pass on to my son—practical skills and values that will shape his future. I want to teach him how to care for things himself, how to be independent without being detached. I want him to be a kind and caring person, someone who lifts others up. I want him to understand the importance of health and exercise, not as an obligation but as a way to respect his body.\n\nI also want to show him how to cook and manage a kitchen. There’s love and connection in being able to feed yourself and others. It’s a skill that fosters both creativity and self-sufficiency. Finally, I want to help him break down problems into their parts and follow through—whether it’s solving a puzzle, fixing something in the house, or tackling a bigger life goal.\n\nBut here's the catch: my abilities in these topics range from mediocre to terrible. I’m a learner just like he will be. The idea of teaching him how to manage all these parts of life feels daunting because I still struggle with them myself.\n\n#### The Challenge of Becoming a Maker\n\nI find myself in an internal debate - will pushing myself to learn these things seem forced to my son? Will he see through the facade and reject the things I am learning to appreciate? It's easy to worry that he will sense my insecurities or frustrations, and that these feelings will rub off on him, causing him to dislike the very things I want him to embrace.\n\nI want to take advantage of this opportunity. If I can use this desire to improve myself, maybe I can develop habits around being more practical and making them stick. It's ironic that my motivation to \"create\" comes from the fact that in my job, I often don’t produce anything tangible. In my career, I create digital experiences, which are valuable in their own right, but there's something satisfying about making physical things with your hands, whether it's fixing something broken or crafting something new.\n\n#### The Power of Identity and Small Wins\n\nIn James Clear’s _Atomic Habits_, he talks about the importance of [identity-based habits](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits). Instead of focusing on big goals, you choose the kind of person you want to be and take small steps to reinforce that identity. So I’m starting to adopt this mindset: “I’m the type of person who makes and fixes things.” The goal isn’t to be perfect at it from the beginning but to create small, attainable wins that reinforce this idea.\n\nFor me, this might look like tackling one fix around the house each month, even if that means calling in a friend who knows what they’re doing to help me out. Each time I complete a task—whether it’s replacing a light fixture or patching a hole in the wall—it’s a small victory that brings me closer to embodying the identity I want to model for my son.\n\n#### Becoming the Example\n\nUltimately, the process of becoming a maker for my son isn’t about achieving an idealized version of myself. It’s about demonstrating that learning, failing, and trying again are all part of life. It’s about showing him that it’s okay to not be perfect, as long as you keep growing. By embracing small wins, I’m not just teaching him how to fix things or solve problems—I’m teaching him resilience, adaptability, and the value of trying. Or at least that's the plan.","src/content/garden/Becoming a Maker for My Son (and for Me).md","ffb69f09f5e3d500",{"html":64,"metadata":65},"\u003Ch1 id=\"becoming-a-maker-for-my-son-and-for-me\">Becoming a Maker for My Son (and for Me)\u003C/h1>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Every day, I watch my son grow into a more nuanced individual.

Why\n\nCurrently my eBook workflow is entirely dependent on Amazon and the Kindle app. As I move to own and control more of the content I consume I'm attempting to move away from these cloud services which in reality are more like rental services. There are also some sharp edges, I use highlights extensively and when attempting to import highlights to Readwise from Kindle it does not include non-Kindle books.\n\n## Workflow Requirements\n- Easy syncing between my devices\n\t- Android e-reader\n\t- iPhone\n\t- Jailbroken Kindle paperwhite\n- Highlight\n\t- Aggregates all of my highlights in one place\n\t\t- Books\n\t\t- Articles, blogs\n\t\t- Videos\n\t- Easily importable to both PKM and CMS\n- Good reading experience\n\t- Application is easy to use\n\t- Highlights are easy to create\n\n## Current components\n\n### Calibre and Calibre Web\n**Organization and metadata**\n  \nThese are the standard for self-hosting an eBook collection. Critically Calibre Web allows me to \"email\" books to my kindle account which populates the book on each of my devices. This is a convenience I will need to replicate if any new system has a chance of surviving with me. These are a cornerstone of the system and I am not willing to change them.\n### Readwise.io\n**Annotations and article saving**\n\nThis is an article saving and highlight aggregator which integrates well with my current notetaking app (Obsidian). I am open to other options here.\n### Obsidian\n**Personal knowledge management and CMS**\n\nIn this context the Readwise plugin for Obsidian allows me to easily import my highlights so I can reference them when writing notes. I am open to other options here as well but I think change is unlikely.\n## Options\n\n### Current solution: Kindle, Calibre, Readwise, Obsidian\n- Quick explanation of flow\n\t- eBooks are added to Calibre which populates them in Calibre web\n\t- In calibre web I can use the \"mail to kindle\" feature to add documents to my kindle account\n\t- I can download the document on any of my devices and read + make highlights\n\t- Highlights are synced to Readwise\n\t\t- BAD: Kindle highlights on \"non-kindle\" documents do not sync with Readwise\n\t- Readwise highlights are populated in Obsidian as notes\n\t- Notes from Obsidian populate this garden\n- Thoughts on flow\n\t- Syncing is effortless\n\t- I can offer my friends logins to my Calibre web server so they can read my books\n\t- Kindle app is pretty good\n\t- Highlights from non-Kindle documents not syncing is a death knell\n\t- Readwise to Obsidian to website is pretty seamless\n### Use Readwise Reader books\n\n##### Easy syncing\n- Exact same functionality as amazon with \"email\" to account\n\t- Does not work with kindle\n\n**Grade: A**\n\n##### Highlights\n- Obviously integrates with Readwise\n- Best highlight-over-two-pages experience I've seen\n- Annoying bug on Android after highlighting over multiple pages where scroll mode changes and I need to quit out and return\n\n**Grade: B** \nGreat except for the one persistent bug on Android\n\n##### Reading\n- Overall solid with good options for customization\n- I really enjoy the vertical scroll pagination \n\n### Bookfusion\nhttps://www.bookfusion.com/\n\nBookfusion is an affordable service with an iOS and android application for reading. Let's look at how it stacks up with my requirements:\n##### Easy syncing\nBookfusion offers an excellent syncing experience primarily because it integrates directly with my Calibre server. The integration allows both my android eReader and iPhone can download books directly from my collection without any additional set up. I doubt I will find an easier syncing solution than Bookfusion.\n\nThe one caveat is that there is currently no way to integrate Bookfusion into my jailbroken Kindle paperwhite, but that's a sacrifice I may be willing to endure because of other features.\n\n**Grade: A+**\nAmazing experience which unfortunately does not include the Kindle\n##### Highlights\nBookfusion does offer a Readwise integration, but it's manually triggered which is a bummer. They mention in documentation that an automated sync may come later depending on demand and usage, but for now, no auto syncing. Bookfusion does offer a direct Obsidian export which would bypass the need for Readwise for books only. That option requires additional configuration and maintaining two separate syncing highlight sources since Bookfusion does not support article saving like Readwise.\n\n**Grade: C**\nDoes the job with some rough edges\n### Reading and highlighting experience\nI've used both apps and the reading experience is quite good. Customization is excellent with many different font and color options as well as fine grained control over font-size and line spacing.\n\nHighlighting I find a bit rougher then I would like it to be. When you create a selection of text a context menu appears with several tools and I need to get my thumb all the way to the other side of the screen to click the highlight tool. This may seem minor, I do the action enough that this small grievance becomes very annoying over time. I personally will almost never use any of the other tools and would much prefer an experience where selecting creates highlights by default much like how the Kindle app behaves.\n\n**Grade: B**\nGreat reading, mediocre highlighting\n  \n\n## References\n\n  \n\n - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtk7ERwlIAk\n\n - https://github.com/MobiusSync/MobiusSync","src/content/garden/De-Amazoning My Reading Workflow.md","3ad7746942e4af24",{"html":228,"metadata":229},"\u003Ch2 id=\"why\">Why\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Currently my eBook workflow is entirely dependent on Amazon and the Kindle app. As I move to own and control more of the content I consume I’m attempting to move away from these cloud services which in reality are more like rental services.

It is a fork of Vim which itself is descended from VI. As a terminal based editor it is built to be used entirely with the keyboard which allows for extremely efficient coding once it's mastered.\n\nThe primary difference between Neovim and Vim seems to boil down to api organization and Lua support which has allowed the plugin ecosystem for Neovim to thrive.\n## Installation\n1. Make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed\n2. Choose a modern terminal emulator like [wezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)to install. At least wezTerm can be installed with: `brew install wezTerm`\n3. `brew install neovim`\n## Configuration\nI found the thought of installing and configuring 20 plugins extremely intimidating and so chose to use a starter config called [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/) which includes essential plugin and basic configuration. Check the NVChad website for up to date steps but at the time of writing it was as simple cloning the config into your `~/.config/nvim` folder.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/NvChad/starter ~/.config/nvim && nvim\n```\n\n```ad-tip\nIf you think you'll do any custom configuration (you will), you may want to fork the NVChad starter config and use your fork. That way you'll be able to pull any changes you make easily to any system you're using.\n\nAdd lazy-lock.json to a .gitignore\n```\n### Setting up code servers with LSP\nIf you're going to use Neovim to code you'll likely want to set up LSP (Language Server Protocol) servers and auto completions for your language of choice. NVChad already includes nvim-lspconfig, nvim-cmp, and all of the other intermediary packages required for completions to work. Simply check out [this documentation](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) and follow the instructions for what you need.

To someone used to normal code or document editors this will feel extremely unintuitive as you cannot simply move the cursor somewhere and start typing. In Neovim you start in \"normal\" mode where you are allowed to move the cursor but not type. In order to type you need to enter \"insert\" mode which by default is done with the \"i\" button.\n\n```ad-note\nThroughout the rest of this note I will be writing hot keys as they are written in Neovim config files. Control(^) is C, Alt(⌥) or option is A, and Shift(⇧) is S. A combined keypress like Control + v would be written as \\\u003CC-v\\>\n```\n#### Common modes\n1. Normal (esc when in other modes) - Used for basic navigation and entering other modes\n2. Insert (i, I, o , a, A) - Used for typing\n3. Visual (v, V, \\\u003CC-v\\>) - Used for highlighting blocks\n4. Command (:) - Used for running commands\nThe keys shown above are almost certainly not exhaustive and I'll update them as I learn more.\n### Non obvious controls\n#### Terminal modes\nWhen focused in the terminal you can enter \"nterminal\" or normal terminal mode with \\\u003CC-x\\> which allows\n\n### My customizations","src/content/garden/Neovim.md","70a4ef86f5b3aa40",{"html":535,"metadata":536},"\u003Ch1 id=\"neovim\">Neovim\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>NeoVim is a text editor which runs entirely within the terminal.

One small reason I still pull it out of my locked server rack is to look at bus times on the OneBusAway app. Inevitably this interaction can lead to more undesirable interactions and so I'm looking to eliminate it. Unfortunately, there is no OneBusAway app for WearOS but I'm sure I can solve this problem with a little code and my [[Homelab]].\n\n## Architecture\n![[bus-times-architecture.excalidraw.png]]\nI run a service called n8n on my [[Homelab]] which allows a user to easily build automations with a flowchart-like UI. n8n does not have any WearOS integration but IFTTT (which is a similar service found at IFTTT.com) does. IFTTT allows me to have a button which when pressed calls a webhook to activate the n8n flow.\n\nOnce n8n is invoked it sends a get call to the OneBusAway API in order to get the arrivals at my designated stop and uses a service called Pushover to send a notification to my phone which is forwarded to my smartwatch.\n\n## IFTTT setup\n![[bus-times-ifttt-setup.excalidraw.png]]\nThe IFTTT set up is very simple, a button press and a webhook. The webhook request will go to the n8n URL (shown in the flow) and the generated the credentials needed are injected into the headers.\n\n## n8n setup\n![[Pasted image 20240924155505.png]]\nThe webhook step will allow you to configure the credentials.

This hyper-fixation is a common occurrence for me and these short-term obsessions tend to burn out. Based on my ongoing and deepening love for my [[Homelab]] I have found that if these bursts of interest align with my goals and interests they can survive the initial burnout once the hyper-fixation fades. Too many of these interests are roadkill in my rearview mirror and my disposable income is the lowest it's ever been so I'm going to overanalyze here to answer the question.\n##### *Should I buy a 3D printer?*\n\n## Why I Shouldn't Buy One\nI'll start with the case against and hopefully be able to address each point below. The most obvious reason against is that I don't have any specific thing which I want to use the printer for that feels like an overwhelming reason to buy one. I have several smaller applications I can think of like:\n- Organizers for small parts and board game boxes\n- Cooler pieces for board games\n- A cup-holder extender so my water bottle will fit in the car\n- Miniatures for D&D nights\n- Clips, hangers, and other doodads\nThese are all fun but none is a reason to spend significant funds on a 3D printer.\n\nThe second reason I shouldn't buy a 3D printer is that my track record with gear like this is very hit-or-miss. My ADD can cause hyper-fixation which has resulted in me buying many expensive hobby starters which have gone unused.\n## Why I Want One\nAs I mentioned above there's no specific thing I want to print with the printer which is both a pro and a con in this argument. I'm not fixed on a specific item or class of items I want but I'm attached to the idea that I can design something to print myself which fits my specific requirements. Similar to running a Homelab, 3D printing is a hobby with infinite uses and therefore I believe it can serve a similar role to my Homelab but for my goal of [[Making]] more.\n\nThe counterargument is that I started my Homelab already possessing a ton of the skills I needed for that hobby. I've continued to learn but there's a massive difference between evolving a skillset and gaining a new one. Learning CAD software to design things to print is a large undertaking (and a barrier to entry), though I have done some 3D modeling before and it *is* software that is a strong suit of mine. CAD is also a valuable skill that has near-infinite uses both at home and in the job market.\n\n## A Commitment to Who I Want to Be\nBuying expensive hobby equipment as a form of commitment to the hobby feels a bit like having a kid to save your marriage, a flawed premise. I have a garage full of expensive and unused beer brewing equipment to prove that it doesn't work. But, as I explored in [[Becoming a Maker for My Son (and for Me)]], my motivation and appetite for self-improvement has never been higher. There are key differences between this potential investment and my sad collection of brewing equipment.\n\nBrewing as a hobby was grown around a friendship with a person I've since lost contact with and without that relationship it could not survive the hobby battle royale that rages in my brain 24/7. I love beer and I enjoyed making it, but the passion for it was a shared experience that faded alongside our friendship. My interest in a 3D printing hobby is driven by my desire to learn, make, and become the kind of person who can make. Fair or not, I see my inability to make and repair physical things as a hole in my person and as I watch my son mirroring me and my flaws it's one I am driven to fill.\n\n## A Bridge from Virtual to Physical\nNetworks, software, servers, and websites all make sense to me implicitly. Despite my lack of experience in the physical making space, I believe my brain is suited for it. I'm good at spatial visualization and in mediums I'm comfortable with, like cardboard, I'm able to build, create, and problem-solve to accomplish my goals. Much of my discomfort with physical making stems from a lack of knowledge on how to manipulate the materials. 3D printing is unique in that you can design physical objects using software and then perfectly create them in materials with a variety of properties. I hope that this bridge from the virtual to the physical can start to tear down the mental barrier I have in front of physical making.\n\n## So Yes or No?\nIt's a yes. It's a productive hobby that aligns with my goals and provides immediate and future value to my household. It facilitates building my identity in the way I want to grow and bridges the gap between my current abilities and the skills I want to obtain. From experience, I know I can't predict if I'll stick with a hobby truly but the similarity between a 3D printer and my Homelab as a catalyst project makes me believe that I will.\n\nWriting this also clarified my brewing hobby, and I think I'm ready to part with that gear, which should provide the space and funds I need to get started.","src/content/garden/Should I Get a 3D Printer.md","e2131f346c1505f1",{"html":779,"metadata":780},"\u003Ch1 id=\"should-i-get-a-3d-printer\">Should I Get a 3D Printer\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Since I stumbled upon \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WwGkFbwygI\">this video\u003C/a> from SuperfastMatt, in which he makes the case that “it’s time to put a 3d printer in your garage”, my mind has been consumed with the idea.

That was likely their original design intention. Modern smartwatches can be used without your smartphone being on your person, and that's where the magic lies.\n## The Addiction\n\nAlgorithmic feed addiction is a real problem. Modern feeds like TikTok and Instagram exploit a software bug in the bio-computer we call a brain to flood us with dopamine and keep us hooked. I never had issues with traditional addictions, but I found myself waking up from a YouTube Shorts-fueled fugue state, wondering how much of my life I had just swiped away.\n\nI tried using apps and timers to block access, uninstalling, changing my screen to black and white, and using minimalist launchers, but the real problem is access.

Web Components Are Important - Playground\n\nI want to talk about a feature of web components that I have never seen mentioned and is what I believe sets them apart from compiled frameworks, and that's their *uncompiled* nature.\n\nBefore you comment, yes, I'm aware that the best and easiest way to write web components is by using compiled frameworks like Lit and Stencil, but that's not what I mean when I say they are \"uncompiled.\" I mean that applications built using web components can be composed and configured in an uncompiled HTML file and so are *composable at runtime*.\n\n## Composability at Runtime\n\nThis metaphor may be a bit stretched, but bear with me: imagine buying a Lego pirate ship. It's meticulously designed to come together as a cohesive whole. Each small piece, like cannons, is custom-fabricated to contribute to the final product. This is how I view compiled frameworks. While you might be able to reuse those cannons from a medieval battle set, they will always be part of a \"compiled\" product (or application) when sold.\n\nWeb component frameworks *can* be like selling a collection of pieces, allowing users to assemble them however they choose, even if they aren’t master Lego builders. Just as Lego pieces have universally sized studs to connect seamlessly, web components use the familiar mechanisms of a standard HTML element. This allows developers to encapsulate complex applications within a web component, enabling other pieces to connect through a straightforward interface.\n\n- Writing web-components can be seen as extending HTML itself instead\n\nApplications made from web components can be easily composed in a simple HTML file with minimal guidance, making it accessible to anyone without domain expertise.

is a full-fledged philosophy of technology use, rooted in your deep values, that provides clear answers to the questions of what tools you should use and how you should use them and, equally important, enables you to confidently ignore everything else. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=109))\n- As whistleblower Tristan Harris explains: “Apps and websites sprinkle intermittent variable rewards all over their products because it’s good for business.” ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=351))\n- The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, . . . was all about: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=357))\n- It tends to be these early, pre-feedback-era features that people cite when explaining why social media is important to their life. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=363))\n- you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=402))\n- We didn’t sign up for the digital lives we now lead. They were instead, to a large extent, crafted in boardrooms to serve the interests of a select group of technology investors. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=409))\n- What he needs—what all of us who struggle with these issues need—is a philosophy of technology use, something that covers from the ground up which digital tools we allow into our life, for what reasons, and under what constraints. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=439))\n- Digital Minimalism A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=443))\n- Even when a new technology promises to support something the minimalist values, it must still pass a stricter test: Is this the best way to use technology to support this value? If the answer is no, the minimalist will set to work trying to optimize the tech, or search out a better option. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=448))\n- minimalists don’t mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large things they already know for sure make a good life good. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=460))\n- Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=531))\n- “The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=573))\n- more often than not, the cumulative cost of the noncrucial things we clutter our lives with can far outweigh the small benefits each individual piece of clutter promises. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=619))\n- the second principle of minimalism, which states that optimizing how we use technology is just as important as how we choose what technologies to use in the first place. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRBP7G&location=635))\n- The first is that most of these technologies are still relatively new. Because of this reality, their role in your life can still seem novel and fun, obscuring more serious questions about the specific value they’re providing.

That’s normal, I promise. But that’s also why it’s important to only build what you need – it’s already a time-consuming task to manufacture a setting and you can easily spend years on it without ever running a single game session. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=380))\n- My first outline for Tydalus looks like this: A ship is blown off course and wrecks on an island revealed by the abnormally low tide. The ship’s crew discovers a temple on the island and accidentally disturbs it. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=401))\n- The horrors inside drive one of the non-player characters mad, who will have crazed but accurate insight about the monster. The characters escape the mysterious island, but they must protect Korvath from what was unleashed. They find magic to defeat the antagonist. They deploy the magic in a final confrontation. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=403))\n- Your game needs an antagonist. That’s the dragon. Your players need to know how to reach the dragon, so you provide a map. And finally, they need incentive to go there. That’s the treasure. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=407))\n- Let’s face it – there’s not a lot of character interaction you can have with a lake of pissed-off goo. So my story needs a secondary antagonist, someone the player characters can talk to, someone who can have more character arc than a shoggoth. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=439))\n- But I’ll be sure to give this NPC some lucid moments, too.

([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=464))\n- It’s a simple way to keep an NPC from taking over the group and stealing the spotlight. The first mate’s “orders” will involve a lot of Hey, talk to that person for me and You know this place, so where should we go? The first mate remains ostensibly in charge and I can issue some orders if I need to give the PCs a nudge, but I’ll mostly have him hang back – without sacrificing his authority. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=478))\n- Writers say show, don’t tell. That showing information you want your readers to know will always have greater impact than simply telling them. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=493))\n- crisis scenes are a series of skill checks or rolls to do important, exciting tasks in a role-playing game other than combat. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=496))\n- One of the great things about a crisis is that you can have your player characters succeed in a story-critical challenge, no matter how badly they roll. The cost will just be high as a result. Or you can have them fail at something that they need to fumble, but the characters can do so gracefully if the players roll well. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=498))\n- A “scene” is where stuff happens, when there’s action or knowledge dumps, and events occur. If a novel is made up of only action-packed scenes, the narrative becomes both exhausting and difficult to follow. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=533))\n- Readers require an occasional break to absorb what happened, and so do the characters in the novel – that’s the sequel. A scene’s sequel is a rest, the pause between waves. It helps break the story into digestible chunks, and does the same for a role-playing game. It gives your characters and your players a moment to breathe, to understand and discuss what just happened and then what to do next. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=534))\n- But before the PCs can get into any prolonged conversation, a bell rings. It’s an alarm ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07K3T2XB4&location=561))\n- I think it will work because it’s a small-scale indicator and reminder of what they face with the full-sized shoggoth.

And every day ... Until one day ... And because of this ... And because of this ... Until finally ... And ever since that day ... ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=147))\n- Once upon a time and And every day. They are your act 1. What is the purpose of act 1? It tells the audience everything they need to know to understand the story that is to follow. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=166))\n- Every decision you make should be based on the idea of dramatizing your armature idea. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=375))\n- This is what is meant by dramatization. It is showing rather than telling. We know that those things to which we have an emotional connection stick with us better than those for which we have none. Dramatization is a way to get your intellectual ideas across to your audience emotionally. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=554))\n- The second act is a kind of ritual pain that changes your character. Usually your character has what has been called a fatal flaw. There is something they need to learn before they can be transformed into a better, more mature, person. ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=804))\n- Because change is never easy, and is resisted, it is your job as storyteller to apply as much pressure on your characters as possible. You must back them into a corner and force them to change. Make it as painful as you can. ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=837))\n- A character always knows what he wants, but hardly ever what he needs. In the end, the character usually gets close to what he wants and chooses the need instead. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=847))\n- Find that thing that your character would rather die than do and make them do it. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=883))\n- What is the ritual pain that begins his change? His father is shot. Michael may not approve of his family’s business, but he does care for them. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=942))\n- At the end of this scene, Marion has decided to give back the money. She is better now, so although we may be shocked that she is killed, we do not feel cheated. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1063))\n- It only happened ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1092))\n- because the storytellers wanted it to happen, but not because it was a logical thing a reasonable person would do. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1092))\n- It is the same with a hero. If you can show that a hero had fears, doubts, and human foibles but did a heroic thing anyway, it makes him all the more heroic. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1123))\n- Masculine traits are anything that moves the story forward externally. For example, Character A, a policeman, finds out that the murderer in the case he’s investigating is another cop. That is a masculine element. The murdering cop is Character A’s best friend and once risked his life to save Character A. This is a female element. It is the balance of these two elements that creates dramatic tension and keeps an audience interested. It keeps their brains working: What is Character A going to do? It creates depth. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1167))\n- Your responsibility as a storyteller is to be a good teacher, not a good preacher. If you only talk about what you want to say, you are only proselytizing. But if you show your audience through ([Location 1321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1321))\n- demonstration, it will learn, seemingly, on its own. Not only that, but its members will learn it more thoroughly. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1322))\n- Genre is irrelevant to the dramatist. A dramatist should only be concerned with drama. If one genre can help you tell your story better than another, use it. No genre is better or worse than another. ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1346))\n- Simply put, the climax of a story puts the protagonist in an intense situation that forces a choice that shows growth or lack of growth. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1400))\n- What happens is that storytellers try to include subplots to flesh out their world and make it feel full. This is never a reason to introduce a character or subordinate (sub) plot. I like to call them supporting plots. They are there to support the main plot. Everything should hang off the same armature. ([Location 1415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1415))\n- Guess what—that is not so. You are a slave to your story, not a master. Your characters, places, scenes, and sequences must be built around the armature. ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1427))\n- Exposition is some of the hardest writing to do. Finding a natural way to have characters speak ([Location 1497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1497))\n- things they already know can seem impossible at times. It is easy to do it clumsily. This is the kind of thing you should learn from observing the way others do it. ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1498))\n- As a storyteller, your job is to get out of the way of the story. This isn’t about you. It may be about what you have to say, but it isn’t about you. Let go of your ego. ([Location 1511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1511))\n- Sometimes audience members need a representative within ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1520))\n- the narrative. It allows you to address and dismiss their concerns so that they can stay engrossed in the story. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1520))\n- After it was revealed, a hush came over the audience as they took in the magnificent ship. Then Luke exclaims, “What a piece of junk!” The crowed erupted with laughter, because that’s not at all what we were thinking. This was George Lucas’s world and we knew nothing about it. There is no way we would have known that the ship was considered a piece of junk without that clever bit of dialogue. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1531))\n- The conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed. Except when the surprise is a twist, that is, when the unexpected ending is, in itself, the highlight of the story. —Alfred Hitchcock ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06W5KC2ZR&location=1550))\n- This form of invisible ink is often ignored by inexperienced storycrafters. They will often jump right to the third little pig expecting the audience will “get it.” It won’t.

It is the balance of these two elements that creates dramatic tension and keeps an audience interested. It keeps their brains working: What is Character A going to do? It creates depth.

Everyone takes part and everyone contributes. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=132))\n- Better to take a breather than paint yourself into a corner with rushed improvisation. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=204))\n- If you’ve decided to Storytell, then tell your story. The players collaborate and weave their ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=239))\n- characters into your creation, not the other way around. Make things happen to the players, don’t wait for them to do everything. They don’t know your plot and they can’t guide the story alone. People should come to them for help, villains should menace them, danger should court them. Shit needs to go down and the players’ role is to react to it. You take their reactions and make it a part of the game, but the Storyteller needs to be an active force, not a passive one. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=240))\n- When I plan out my games beforehand, I don’t have to devote much energy to moving the story along once the campaign begins. I know where it’s going and I know what will happen to the characters. So the rest of my energy can be devoted to running with their ideas, taking their tangents and making them work for the story. Players can enjoy their exploration and experimentation and I can use it to add to the plot instead of taking us away from it. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=256))\n- I can easily cannibalize all of those notes to make up the new scene. I either use the one that I planned in whole, or else raid it for parts. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=265))\n- The game should be challenging enough that players have to think and work, but they’re supposed to be the heroes of the story and I want ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=321))\n- them to feel heroic. Instead of putting my players into situations where a single bad die roll might cost them a character, I prefer to let them escape with a scar of some kind. Something that’s game-affecting in a small but noticeable way: a limp that costs them a little movement, the loss of an eye that raises alertness difficulties, and so on. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=322))\n- But don’t throw away those weaker villains you used back in the beginning! We’re not done with them quite yet. Every once in a while, send some of those low-level baddies up against the characters – probably in larger numbers. They’re a measuring stick now and the players get to compare themselves against their earlier performance. The orc that used to take five hits now goes down in just one, and your players are piling up the bodies. It shows them how far they’ve come and how much their characters have grown in power. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=346))\n- I have a formula that I use to build almost every game. I call it Map, Dragon, Treasure. It’s a simple formula. The map is a way to find out what’s happening and how to get there.

If they do face the player characters in combat, then you have to decide if the bad guy is going to kick their asses, or if the heroes will win. If you defeat the players, then you have to justify why the villain lets the characters live, or provide some deus ex machina to save them. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=475))\n- It’s usually better to have your antagonist interact with the characters verbally, preferably in situations where a social or physical barrier prevents them from going right for each other’s throats.

The stick is often called the Storyteller Hammer because it’s a brute force tool. You know the stick: “A bajillion bad guys surround you. They are heavily armed and hold your pet bunny hostage.

Instead of forcing them to give up, making them feel helpless and resorting to insults to retain their pride, you can get the characters to work with you and participate in their own capture. Use the carrot. Make them feel noble and heroic for giving themselves up. ([Location 671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=671))\n- Even if you can’t make their capture heroic, allow the characters to notice the guard patrol patterns or the locations of security measures so they feel like they can plan an escape. Basically, let the players resist, but give them an outlet for it that serves your story instead of just trading insults.

([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=784))\n- At the end of the chapter, I provide an extra reward to all of my players to advance their characters. Usually, it’s a bonus to health or damage or perhaps the opportunity to select a new power from a short list. But everyone gets these rewards. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=846))\n- My advice is to start slow. You can always award more experience later on, but if you give it out too fast, you can’t take it back and may find your game ramping up to a power level that you didn’t intend. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=872))\n- a player who is creating a dramatic arc is telling the story of their own character. As far as their personal story is concerned, your player is the Storyteller. You can help by working with them to offer opportunities to advance their arc. If the character is looking for revenge, make sure the object of that revenge occasionally rears its head to spur them on.

But for now, let’s keep playing.” ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1046))\n- When something happens in the game world, that world can’t just sit there not reacting. If there’s no reaction, the story happens in a weird vacuum and the players start to suffocate. So if an army is building up somewhere, people need to notice and comment on all those mercenaries heading out west, or the townsfolk should talk about how much iron is being bought up by the guy who’s girding for war. ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1520))\n- The world is a place for the story to happen, not a substitute for the story itself. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1555))\n- One of the first things you should consider is the scope of your game. What’s at stake in the story? The whole world? The entire universe? Or maybe just the fate of a single person? How big a world do you need to detail? Sometimes you only require a single city, which will be the setting for the entire story. ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1556))\n- Make free use of story archetypes: the gruff lawman, the town drunk, the slick thief. There’s a reason that certain personalities are archetypal and they’ll stand out in your players’ memories. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1598))\n- but sometimes you need the characters to just loathe someone. Usually that’s the villain, but on occasion it is a more neutral character – you don’t ever really want them to hate an ally – that the players sometimes have to deal with. Forcing them to go to an NPC they don’t like can make for a great “last resort” feel. ([Location 1610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1610))\n- The important thing is that you want the characters to hate the NPC more than the players do. If the players don’t want to deal with someone because they’re annoying or the wrong kind of creepy, then they’re not going to have fun. Disliking a sleazy little weasel of an NPC should be its own kind of fun. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1613))\n- For NPCs that will be in contact with the players frequently or for a long time, I add a one-line motivation or goal. ([Location 1617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1617))\n- It’s a good idea to make sure that the characters aren’t stuck with the comic relief. If they don’t turn out to be as funny as you hoped, or if the players actively dislike them, then it will be unpleasant if the PCs can’t get rid of them. ([Location 1630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1630))\n- Each NPC only gets a fraction of the development time that a PC does, so keep it simple and consistent. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1637))\n- If they’re in a position where an NPC is giving them orders, try to allow the players a lot of leeway on how to carry out those orders. The ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1642))\n- Most of my authority figures tend toward antagonistic. If the authority is friendly to the PCs, it removes much of the challenge. ([Location 1654](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1654))\n- My chief piece of advice is not to make any combat rolls for NPCs in a fight. ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1707))\n- Use them to shake up the combat scenes or introduce new elements. Maybe one of the NPCs gets wounded during the fight. It then becomes the job of a player character to administer emergency medical attention ([Location 1717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1717))\n- For instance, Simon Stone the gunslinger provides covering fire for his friends, allowing one character extra movement each round. Jaden the assassin strikes the enemies’ pressure points, crippling them and penalizing their attack rolls each round. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1728))\n- Never get so attached to your non-player characters – especially the villains – that you can’t get rid of them the very instant they no longer serve a purpose, get in the way, or when dramatic tension calls for their blood. ([Location 1737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1737))\n- Do not make an NPC for you to play. I’ve done it, and regretted it every single time. ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009XYBS0A&location=1748))\n- An exception to this rule is mentors and other authority figures. They may be a necessary component to a story, and it can be appropriate for them to help the PCs.

Make things happen to the players, don’t wait for them to do everything. They don’t know your plot and they can’t guide the story alone. People should come to them for help, villains should menace them, danger should court them. Shit needs to go down and the players’ role is to react to it. You take their reactions and make it a part of the game, but the Storyteller needs to be an active force, not a passive one.

Instead of putting my players into situations where a single bad die roll might cost them a character, I prefer to let them escape with a scar of some kind.

We’re not done with them quite yet. Every once in a while, send some of those low-level baddies up against the characters – probably in larger numbers. They’re a measuring stick now and the players get to compare themselves against their earlier performance. The orc that used to take five hits now goes down in just one, and your players are piling up the bodies. It shows them how far they’ve come and how much their characters have grown in power.

If there’s no reaction, the story happens in a weird vacuum and the players start to suffocate. So if an army is building up somewhere, people need to notice and comment on all those mercenaries heading out west, or the townsfolk should talk about how much iron is being bought up by the guy who’s girding for war.

Usually that’s the villain, but on occasion it is a more neutral character – you don’t ever really want them to hate an ally – that the players sometimes have to deal with. Forcing them to go to an NPC they don’t like can make for a great “last resort” feel.

Yes. They are right in front of us. Yes. They are answering our questions and talking, but a big chunk of them is missing. (Page 54)\n- most parents doing child care have the desire to run from their kids, even if it’s just a feeling. Like, How can I get away for a minute? We’ve all checked Facebook on the toilet with the door locked and little fingers trying to get under the door. (Page 55)\n- Our kids operate best on a full emotional gas tank. You fill that tank through connection. (Page 55)\n- I’m suggesting that you do not put so much focus on your child. (Page 56)\n- If you’re attempting 100 percent focus on your kids, you will crash and burn. Which will lead to feelings of “Fuck it. I deserve a break. I deserve to look at my phone while I’m coloring with this kid.” (Page 56)\n- If you are giving 50 percent presence to your child 100 percent of the time, and that makes the child still 100 percent needy, it’s just a bad investment of your time. Whereas if you can be 100 percent present but for smaller chunks of time, and that fills your child’s emotional tank and buys you some “off ” time, that’s a brilliant investment. (Page 56)\n- They need to know they matter and not in a secondary way. (Page 57)\n- What I’m talking about is creating moments when you are 100 percent. That’s what will fill their bucket. (Page 58)\n- You may hear “Read to me” and just know that means endless books and a fit if you try to limit the time or number of books. So you may resort to a push-off, like Sure. In a minute. When I’m done with x-y-z. Not right now, but later. I just read to you, I have to make dinner. (Page 58)\n- Your child is experiencing an attention scarcity. So when she gets some attention, she is going to attempt to overfill herself. It feels wonderful to have your parents that present. It shines soul-filling light into their little hearts. They’re not stupid: they want to hang on to that particular joy. It reminds me of one of my least favorite phrases ever: “Oh, he’s just doing that for attention.” Dude. Give him attention. (Page 59)\n- When your child knows that you will have to leave the connection activity but that there will be more, he is more likely to be peaceful when you extricate yourself. (Page 59)\n- It doesn’t take much to fill it, but likewise, it doesn’t take much to empty it. Big emotions (like tantrums) will drain it, as will exciting outings like the zoo or children’s museum. Believe it or not, playgrounds aren’t that great a place to connect either. (Page 59)\n- Toddlers love routine, so having a regularly scheduled reading time works wonders for filling that tank. (Page 60)\n- Play-Doh, artwork, coloring—any hands-on table/ sit down work. While playing, be sure to verbally engage. “I’m making the longest snake in the world. What are you making?” (Page 60)\n- “Let’s go lay down and just chitchat.” My niece would always fall asleep, but it also became their thing. “Mem, can we go lay down and chitchat?” (Page 61)\n- Movies and downtime. Watching a movie with your child can either be a fantastic break for you or it can be wildly engaging. (Page 61)\n- “Yes, you can watch a show, but I need to do some things so I won’t be watching (Page 61)\n- You know it when you’re in it because it also fills your cup/ bucket/ emotional gas tank. You feel like a stellar parent; it lifts you up rather than exhausting you. (Page 63)\n- At first, you may have to do shorter but more frequent connections. This lets the child know that there is more coming. (Page 64)\n- It can be very helpful to use the actual words connection and disconnection. “I feel very disconnected from you; let’s sit and read a story so we can connect.” This is a great tool as your kids get older. Having emotional language to wrap around feelings can be amazing! Your child will be able to articulate her feeling of disconnection, (Page 66)\n- put your phone in airplane mode for chunks of time lasting at least an hour. (Page 67)\n- For our generation of parents, in our particular society, it has become the norm to serve at the altar of parental martyrdom, (Page 70)\n- Therefore, your relationship has to be solid, because it is the foundation on which everything else is built! (Page 75)\n- and boy howdy, do little ones need slow transitions. (Page 77)\n- If a child is at the center of everything we do, how can that child not start to feel like she is indeed the center of everything? (Page 78)\n- When we don’t emphasize the family as a whole over the individuals, then the child will simply learn that his individual needs come first and he will act accordingly, entitled and demanding. (Page 78)\n- “A child not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.” (Page 78)\n- As Maya Angelou said, “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” (Page 82)\n- It’s creating that village vibe so that our kids feel a deep connection and love within that circle. (Page 82)\n- One mom I worked with was just drowning in perfect parenting. Nothing she did was just for her well-being. Even showering was an ordeal. Her husband would come home and try to give her a break but her little boy would go crazy trying to find her when she attempted a mom-escape to another room. Finally, we figured out that Mom just had to walk out the door. She’d go for a brisk twenty-minute walk and come home rejuvenated. It was easier for her husband to take over dad duty when she actually left the house. (Page 85)\n- Do you have a hobby or interest that takes you out of the house? Something that has nothing to do with parenting? I totally understand if you love crafting things for your littles or love to bake. What I’m looking for, though, is something outside that. Something that allows you to interact with other grown-ups and not talk about your kids. (Page 86)\n- She was to use those walks to think about something she’d like to do that had nothing to do with her little one. At first, all she could think about was things that somehow related to her child or the household. (Page 87)\n- getting up early is far more useful than staying up late. (Page 89)\n- If we put this into a time management system, 20 percent of your time is giving 80 percent of your results. Why would you spend that other 80 percent of your time for a return of 20 percent? (Page 97)\n- Three extra hours to do anything you want with. What would you do with that time? Seriously. Write this down. (Page 98)\n- Remember. You can’t make time if you don’t know what you’re making time for. (Page 98)\n- As a parent, you may be familiar with this phenomenon. It’s nap time, your child goes down, and there’s so much to do, you are paralyzed. So you either take a nap or scroll FB ’cause You. Just. Can’t. Decide. What. To do. (Page 99)\n- This concept is called “big stones first.” Imagine you have one big bucket, and you’re supposed to fill it with a few big stones, a ton of pebbles, and some sand. You have to fit them all in the finite space of that bucket, (Page 100)\n- The trick? Find your big stones and really, really commit to them, (Page 101)\n- What are three life big stones? And what might three weekly big stones be? Three big stones for today? (Page 101)\n- We lose ourselves in fake productivity because a lot of us (myself included) have a trip in our heads about what’s productive and what’s lazy. Midday, sitting down to read a fiction book, while there are dishes in the sink? What a horrible mother you must be! (Page 106)\n- The fix: I now only do dishes in the morning and evening, when I also do my food prep. All other times, it can wait. (Page 108)\n- Pick up toys once a day, at the end of the day. (Page 108)\n- I give myself set times to dick around on Facebook and IG. (Page 109)\n- I only check my phone at certain times and answer all the texts at once. (Page 109)\n- You are creating your own state of busy. And it’s ugly, it’s serving no one, least of all you (or your family), and you get no bonus points from anyone for being busy. Stop the culture of busy. (Page 110)\n- “Create a life you don’t need a vacation from.” (Page 111)\n- Downtime must be a big stone. ’Cause otherwise it won’t fit. (Page 111)\n- What’s the most I can give? that giving the least feels like cheating. It’s not. It’s reclaiming your time. And time is the only commodity in the world that you can’t get back once it’s gone. (Page 111)\n- But generally speaking, we could all do with a big dose of leaving them alone a lot more. (Page 112)\n- To be clear, I’m not telling you to get off your phone. Stay on it. But don’t pretend to be engaged with your kid when you’re not. Be honest. Tell your child to hang on while you dick around on your phone. (Page 113)\n- this push for early academics doing a lot of damage (Page 116)\n- It’s the difference between who you want to be as a person—and who you want your child to be—and who you both are now. (Page 120)\n- “Why can’t he just be a quiet kid?” That’s a useless question that creates anxiety. He’s not. Be cautious not to step into that gap. (Page 120)\n- You should also remember that the world has a lot invested in your feeling not confident. (Page 121)\n- But if you find you are anxious about your parenting, the best thing you can do is stay off the internet. (Page 121)\n- You can replace dirty with hurt. “No, no, you’ll get hurt. Don’t do that. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” (Page 121)\n- Here are some things you can do to calm your fears: (Page 122)\n- Gather a safe village. Be open with a few good friends. (Page 122)\n- “There’s no such thing as being a perfect parent. So be a real one.” (Page 123)\n- Most parental anxiety comes from the idea that you are somehow messing up. Sink into love and connection first and foremost, and you really can’t go wrong. (Page 125)\n- Let’s say your mom was a type A control freak who was very authoritarian. You never got to have a say; your feelings and preferences never counted. You then have a child and swear you will never do that. So you go to the polar opposite and are wildly permissive. (Page 128)\n- She had almost no boundaries, she gave far too many open choices to Clara, and there was no follow-up even when she did try to hold a boundary. (Page 129)\n- Isa was a wildly attentive mom. But emotionally, she wasn’t giving Clara the rules. And Clara was as a result literally going bonkers. (Page 129)\n- When you suddenly set boundaries that you’ve never set before, please expect your child to push up against them. She has to. To see if they’re real, if you are serious, if you do in fact mean business. Children have to push up against you to feel safe! (Page 131)\n- It can feel like they are saying, “No! I don’t want this rule. I don’t want this boundary.” But what they are really saying, if we could articulate the emotional response, is, “Thank God you’re telling me where to stop. But I have to make sure. I have to test you. Because if you don’t hold the boundary, I’ll have to push more.” (Page 131)\n- Parents go nuts if potty training isn’t going well. Why? Because, most often, deep in them somewhere is What If I’m a Shitty Parent? What If I Am Fucking This Up? And as with all trigger points, our conscious and unconscious mind will work overtime at avoiding such a painful notion. (Page 131)\n- The thing to remember is that when you find yourself getting your knickers in a bigger bunch than usual, it’s usually because of a trigger point. (Page 132)\n- Now, there is a second cause for reactionary parenting. It’s your child pushing up against your value system. (Page 132)\n- Or you may make the classic mistake of trying to logic your toddler into respect. Logic at this age is futile; repetition and consistency are the winners for toddlers. (Page 133)\n- “You know, I can see your brain working really hard to find a different solution. I appreciate that about you and we can talk about it, but for now we really have to leave the house.” (Page 140)\n- Most “bad behavior” is caused by • acting out of feelings. • testing your boundaries and their limits. • curiosity: your child thinking, “What happens if I do this?” • your child not being appropriately challenged and therefore becoming challenging. (Page 143)\n- Your average three-year-old is wildly different from just a year ago. With individuation, he is fumbling to find out how he is separate from you. He is entering deep play, which often looks like not listening. He is gaining mastery over his physical abilities and really needs to test the limits of what his little body can do. He doesn’t want to be a baby anymore but he still needs a lot of help. He doesn’t want to be told what to do, yet he still needs direction. (Page 145)\n- Bad child versus bad behavior. It’s important to distinguish “you’re so bad” from “your behavior is very bad right now.” When you call a child bad, psychologically this can be interpreted as the child himself is bad, which can lead to a core belief that will damage the child. (Page 146)\n- You’ll find she’ll develop critical thinking, executive functioning skills, and excellent risk assessment if you ease up on the “Be careful!” (Page 147)\n- Does it matter if your child has learned to read but can’t zipper his own coat? • Does it matter if your child got into Harvard and doesn’t know how to scramble an egg? (Page 150)\n- That chaotic behavior, that contrary, grumpy no to everything you say: that is your little one saying, “I want to figure this out. I want to be my own person.” (Page 152)\n- “Children are far more capable than we allow them to be.” (Page 153)\n- His teacher looked at me and said dryly, “Go nuts. Buy a case of Scotch tape. How much do you spend on toys?” Oof. Shot to the heart, right? (Page 154)\n- Think basic life skills at this age. (Page 155)\n- Giving responsibility is what builds self-esteem, not saying “good job, buddy” a thousand times. (Page 155)\n- Getting dressed. At three years old and definitely by four, your child should be able to dress himself. (Page 155)\n- Pouring a drink. They are fully capable of pouring liquids into glasses. This sometimes requires your putting fluids in a smaller, more manageable container; a gallon of milk is obviously too much, so you can pour milk into a two-cup spouted measuring cup. (Page 155)\n- Light chores. Most kids adore cleaning the toilet. I know. Weird, right? Let them! Light vacuuming, making beds, folding laundry (badly, but still), putting their clothes away, filling their own water bottles are just a few ideas. (Page 156)\n- children are within the center of your home and life, they feel loved and safe. When we make them the center of the home and life, things get off-kilter. (Page 156)\n- Our guiding question should be “What can our children do for themselves?” This approach takes practice, so be patient with yourself and your child. Reframing the whole day into life skills instead of education and scheduled activities can change everything for the whole family. (Page 160)\n- All you need to do is think, How can I teach her to do more on her own? How can I let her be more independent? (Page 160)\n- Think engagement and connection, rather than educational content. (Page 2370269)\n- they blow me away with their thinking because they don’t have a preconceived notion of what or how anything should be. (Page 2373032)\n- As a culture we are obsessed with production and performance. We want quantifiable results; we love having something to show for our work. This is fine and acceptable in some circumstances, but with our kids, it’s not the way to foster growth and independence. While following exact directions so everyone gets the same results is useful at times, there are pockets in our lives where we want the opposite. (Page 2374936)\n- That’s why we have art. To create and expand our inner and outer worlds. To use color and form and shape to express what words may not. (Page 2375443)\n- You may find yourself uttering the words “No, not like that, like this.” We become invested in the product, not the process. We become mistake monitors. Which puts a huge damper on the little minds working to make the little hands express something. (Page 2376023)\n- First and foremost, you have to let go of the fear of mess. Real expression, true art, and letting go of control means there will be messes. Create space for that in your home. I promise the rewards will be greater than the mess. (Page 2379469)\n    - Note: Gym as a \"room of requirement\"?\n- Let go of the control. Let go of needing an end product. You don’t need it. (Page 2380291)\n- “You seem to be getting frustrated. Do you need help or do you want to stop for now?” (Page 2380893)\n- Try to create an art space, a table, a corner—a place where the supplies can be left out. (Page 2381112)\n- Rather than guessing what it is (and being woefully wrong), ask instead, “Can you tell me about it?” (Page 2382594)\n- For three-dimensional creations, including Lego structures and box forts, take pictures. Make a photo book (Page 2383885)\n- This is the problem with merchandised toys that are modeled after characters from movies and shows. You child will play within the construct of those characters (Page 2385341)\n- As a general culture, we limit risk assessment, thinking our little ones are too little to be trying something risky. (Page 2395993)\n- We also don’t let our kids hash out emotions and social conflict. We tend to “break it up” super fast. This is denying our kids something they need, and again, it can come back to kick you in the ass. (Page 2397410)\n- Children who get lots of Big Play end up sitting still better when it’s time to sit. They listen better. They don’t fidget as much and get so wiggly and obnoxious and annoying. (Page 2399638)\n- A quick note about organized sports. They are not the same as Big Play because they are adult-led and structured, although they tend to use the same muscle groups. (Page 2406717)\n- It leads to taking risks, because really, how can test your own engine if you’re not taking it to the edge? (Page 2407268)\n- But there’s another thing we’ve been sort of hoodwinked into believing, and that is that our kids should never get hurt. That you are a bad parent if your child gets hurt. (Page 2408450)\n- Risk inherently comes with failure. I’m extrapolating into the later years and larger life because there’s no magical older age when you belatedly learn it’s okay to take a risk and it’s okay to fail. (Page 2409710)\n- Self-esteem is not built on careful. (Page 2411108)\n- Try moving . . . your feet slowly, carefully, quickly, strongly.\n  Try using your . . . hands, feet, arms, legs. (Page 2414072)\n- Help them out by asking:\n  What’s your plan . . . if you climb that boulder, cross that street? (Page 2414506)\n- It’s about letting children negotiate their own social context. (Page 2416532)\n- Kids who feel in control of their body, time, and life are less likely to suffer from anxiety and depression in later years. (Page 2418696)\n- Like they have sleeping windows, kids have eating windows. (Page 2431136)\n- Is a sit-down family meal more important at this point in your child’s life or is good sleep? You most likely cannot have both (Page 2432195)\n- But if you are getting crappy behavior around bedtime, it’s almost always because it’s too late. And if you’re getting crappy behavior at dinner, it’s also probably too late. (Page 2432473)\n- A good loose rule is that when you find the right window, your little one will go to sleep almost immediately. And your child will sleep longer. (Page 2436610)\n- If you are struggling with sleep issues, you should move bedtimes earlier and earlier by fifteen-minute increments. (Page 2436895)\n- Hug her and cuddle her and tell her everything is going to be okay. Keep the comforting confined to her room, so that she knows her sleep environment is safe and secure. (Page 2440836)\n- Bedtime is the perfect time to build attachment and open communication about what’s going on in their lives.\n  Try a lot of open-ended questions and ask them while you’re doing certain activities together, like coloring. (Page 2443259)\n- Make yoga a part of your bedtime routine! This is a great way for kids to relax, reduce stimulation, and quiet their minds. (Page 2443603)\n- Always err on the side of more sleep. Treat it as a nutrient. More. Sleep. Always. (Page 2445567)\n- Key words: recognition, valid, worthwhile. Not: to agree with, to be right. (Page 2446024)\n- We don’t give our kids nearly the same courtesy as we give other, bigger humans. Like, if you are boiling hot and I’m freezing cold, you would not tell me, “No, you’re not. It’s so hot. You’re not cold.” (Page 2446523)\n- Our little ones have a lot of feelings, often colliding into each other in their own brains, never mind with you and the outside world. (Page 2447153)\n- We tend to focus on the negative, but we should also acknowledge joy and happiness and the more positive emotions. We tend to gloss over those. (Page 2448019)\n- The ultimate respect is knowing that we aren’t in our children’s bodies. We don’t know if they are really hungry or not. Right? (Page 2448779)\n- Please notice some very specific language here: Yes and. That’s validation. When we use the words Yes but, we almost instantly invalidate. (Page 2449169)\n- Wearing shorts in a snowstorm is most likely going to produce a whining toddler within minutes. Let them decide and cover your bases with just-in-case clothes. A yes and a yes.\n  “I know you are not cold right now. See the snow outside? It’s cold. Let’s put some pants in the bag just in case you do get cold.” Validate and cover your parental ass. (Page 2449954)\n- “Yes. I know you’re not tired and it’s time for bed.” (Page 2452233)\n- If you say, “Yes, you are tired,” you know the response that is almost guaranteed, right? “No, I’m not!” Now you just entered yourself in a power struggle with a tired toddler. (Page 2452449)\n- In the toy-swiping scenario, this might look like, “I can see you are really angry. I would be angry as well. Let’s take a minute and think about what we can do about it.” (Page 2454648)\n- What I normally see play out is the child having a big emotion, justified or not, and parents rushing in to save the child and fix the situation. Listen, there will always be a bully, there will always be a jerk. (Page 2454825)\n- You don’t have to make eighteen pieces of toast to see which cut will suit your child. In fact, it’s not helpful. First off, you’re completely setting up your child to expect you to fix everything. Second, you’re not allowing the actual feeling. You’re unconsciously saying, Don’t feel that. Here. I’ll hurry up and fix it so you’re not feeling the thing. (Page 2455534)\n- “I can see this has made you very angry. Why don’t you take a minute to settle and then we’ll figure out what to do.” I’m using “settle” instead of “calm down” because never in the history of the world have the words calm down made a human calm down. (Page 2455995)\n- but instead of directly addressing the toy stealing, you first address your child’s fury. “Wow, you’re so angry and I understand why. Let’s go over here for a minute and settle your body and we’ll figure out what to do.” (Page 2457484)\n- You can even lean into the feeling. “You are so angry. That was very unfair.” Let your little one vent. Too often we try to hurry up and fix the anger or frustration. It’s okay to let them really feel it. Yes! That sucked! (Page 2457846)\n- There is more societal judgment about discipline than any other area of parenting. (Page 2459231)\n- Punishment is a power dynamic, backed by a notion of “paying for what you did.” The child does something you deem bad and you will make that child “pay for it.” Punishment can seem arbitrary to the child. Punishment can feel like it comes out of the blue, with no warning. The child does something and punishment swoops in. (Page 2460627)\n- The natural consequence feels severe, so we put in an external consequence. You don’t want your child to potentially crack open her head, so you institute something external, like a time-out. The problem is, in most cases, the child makes zero connection between the wrongdoing and the punishment. (Page 2461462)\n- “My child isn’t giving me a hard time. My child is having a hard time.” (Page 2463553)\n- If your child has done something that makes your rage boil, chances are your little one hit a trigger point for you. This is the time to remove yourself. Maybe it means leaving the room. Or hiding out in the parental office, otherwise known as the bathroom. (Page 2466143)\n- You can be very clear with your words: “When you do (x-y-z), I get crazy mad. I’m going to take a break so I can calm down before I talk with you.” Or even a shortened version of “Argh. I’m so angry I need a break. I will be right back.” (Page 2466569)\n- Ownership of your own anger. Not “you made me feel.” (Page 2466849)\n- You are going to take a break; when we feel that sudden onset of anger, we tend to say shit that is useless, ineffective, or mean. Taking a break to calm down is always key.\n  • The last thing to notice is “I’ll be back.” I’m not abandoning you or the situation. I just need a little time. (Page 2466907)\n- But there’s extreme power in doing the opposite. Whispering makes the child have to stop to hear you. Right there, you’ve disrupted the escalation. Whispering is also 100 percent less threatening than yelling. (Page 2467402)\n- Being yelled at sucks in any circumstance. But in front of anyone else, including siblings and family members, getting yelled at is public humiliation. (Page 2467792)\n- When you put your heads literally together to whisper in her ear, you become a team. The child is not left alone with a yucky feeling. (Page 2468669)\n- You can be super effective when you’re looking your little one in the eye, on his level. Kneel down in front of him so you are eye to eye. (Page 2468989)\n- Offer your child a break with or without you. Give him specifics on his behavior. “It looks like you’re having a hard time controlling your body. You need a break. Do you want me to come with you or do you want to be by yourself?” (Page 2470471)\n- Tight bear hugs can actually physically calm a child down. Putting pressure on the skin calms the body. (Page 2470936)\n- I suggest weighted blankets to help them self-regulate. (Page 2471088)\n- “When I’m frustrated, I like to go outside and yell it out.” Or “I like to go throw pillows in my room. Would you like to try that?” (Page 2472102)\n- Whenever they’re possible, I’m a huge fan of natural consequences. In many instances, that simply means leaving. Leaving the party, the store, the park, the friend’s house. If your child is displaying angry, frustrated, or aggressive behavior, oftentimes it means you should leave. (Page 2472333)\n- Three more chances and counting to three are completely ineffective if you don’t actually follow through (Page 2474896)\n- Sometimes that means leaving a full cart of groceries. Sometimes that means getting the check in the restaurant and packing the food to go. (Page 2476000)\n- doing them well.\n  DON’T\n  • (Page 2478356)\n- Don’t make empty threats; don’t threaten something you won’t do. If you aren’t going to leave the party, don’t threaten it. (Page 2478381)\n- Don’t threaten something off in the future. If you feel the need to give a consequence in the moment, it must be in the moment. There has to be a direct cause and effect—otherwise it is useless. (Page 2478760)\n- Respect them by using the same tone you’d use with older people. Using that baby singsong voice is infantilizing them and can even be condescending. (Page 2481150)\n- One, we don’t give our kids the time they need to actually process information and respond. Two, we overlook just how underdeveloped some parts of the brain are at this age. (Page 2483182)\n- It can take a toddler up to forty-five seconds to actually hear your words. Then, because of still-developing executive function skills and limbic systems, it takes time for them to actually sort the words in a meaningful way. (Page 2483477)\n- If you muck up your intention with a bunch of other words, it gets very confusing and your little one will freeze up. Or not hear you. (Page 2485445)\n- Women, myself included, have a tendency to have a thousand browser bars open at all times in our minds. And we’re tracking them all. And we feel the need to explain everything about everything. (Page 2486193)\n## New highlights added May 1, 2025 at 10:31 AM\n- can make a small practice of taking back the object to fill it.

Yes. They are right in front of us. Yes. They are answering our questions and talking, but a big chunk of them is missing. (Page 54)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>most parents doing child care have the desire to run from their kids, even if it’s just a feeling. Like, How can I get away for a minute? We’ve all checked Facebook on the toilet with the door locked and little fingers trying to get under the door. (Page 55)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Our kids operate best on a full emotional gas tank. You fill that tank through connection. (Page 55)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I’m suggesting that you do not put so much focus on your child. (Page 56)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If you’re attempting 100 percent focus on your kids, you will crash and burn. Which will lead to feelings of “Fuck it. I deserve a break. I deserve to look at my phone while I’m coloring with this kid.” (Page 56)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If you are giving 50 percent presence to your child 100 percent of the time, and that makes the child still 100 percent needy, it’s just a bad investment of your time. Whereas if you can be 100 percent present but for smaller chunks of time, and that fills your child’s emotional tank and buys you some “off ” time, that’s a brilliant investment. (Page 56)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They need to know they matter and not in a secondary way. (Page 57)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>What I’m talking about is creating moments when you are 100 percent.

So you may resort to a push-off, like Sure. In a minute. When I’m done with x-y-z. Not right now, but later. I just read to you, I have to make dinner. (Page 58)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Your child is experiencing an attention scarcity. So when she gets some attention, she is going to attempt to overfill herself. It feels wonderful to have your parents that present. It shines soul-filling light into their little hearts. They’re not stupid: they want to hang on to that particular joy. It reminds me of one of my least favorite phrases ever: “Oh, he’s just doing that for attention.” Dude. Give him attention. (Page 59)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>When your child knows that you will have to leave the connection activity but that there will be more, he is more likely to be peaceful when you extricate yourself. (Page 59)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>It doesn’t take much to fill it, but likewise, it doesn’t take much to empty it. Big emotions (like tantrums) will drain it, as will exciting outings like the zoo or children’s museum. Believe it or not, playgrounds aren’t that great a place to connect either.

Her husband would come home and try to give her a break but her little boy would go crazy trying to find her when she attempted a mom-escape to another room. Finally, we figured out that Mom just had to walk out the door. She’d go for a brisk twenty-minute walk and come home rejuvenated. It was easier for her husband to take over dad duty when she actually left the house. (Page 85)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Do you have a hobby or interest that takes you out of the house?

(Page 120)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You should also remember that the world has a lot invested in your feeling not confident. (Page 121)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>But if you find you are anxious about your parenting, the best thing you can do is stay off the internet. (Page 121)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can replace dirty with hurt. “No, no, you’ll get hurt. Don’t do that. Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” (Page 121)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Here are some things you can do to calm your fears: (Page 122)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Gather a safe village. Be open with a few good friends. (Page 122)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“There’s no such thing as being a perfect parent. So be a real one.” (Page 123)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Most parental anxiety comes from the idea that you are somehow messing up. Sink into love and connection first and foremost, and you really can’t go wrong. (Page 125)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Let’s say your mom was a type A control freak who was very authoritarian. You never got to have a say; your feelings and preferences never counted. You then have a child and swear you will never do that. So you go to the polar opposite and are wildly permissive. (Page 128)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>She had almost no boundaries, she gave far too many open choices to Clara, and there was no follow-up even when she did try to hold a boundary. (Page 129)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Isa was a wildly attentive mom. But emotionally, she wasn’t giving Clara the rules. And Clara was as a result literally going bonkers. (Page 129)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>When you suddenly set boundaries that you’ve never set before, please expect your child to push up against them. She has to. To see if they’re real, if you are serious, if you do in fact mean business. Children have to push up against you to feel safe! (Page 131)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>It can feel like they are saying, “No! I don’t want this rule. I don’t want this boundary.” But what they are really saying, if we could articulate the emotional response, is, “Thank God you’re telling me where to stop. But I have to make sure. I have to test you. Because if you don’t hold the boundary, I’ll have to push more.” (Page 131)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Parents go nuts if potty training isn’t going well. Why? Because, most often, deep in them somewhere is What If I’m a Shitty Parent? What If I Am Fucking This Up? And as with all trigger points, our conscious and unconscious mind will work overtime at avoiding such a painful notion. (Page 131)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The thing to remember is that when you find yourself getting your knickers in a bigger bunch than usual, it’s usually because of a trigger point. (Page 132)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Now, there is a second cause for reactionary parenting. It’s your child pushing up against your value system. (Page 132)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Or you may make the classic mistake of trying to logic your toddler into respect. Logic at this age is futile; repetition and consistency are the winners for toddlers. (Page 133)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“You know, I can see your brain working really hard to find a different solution. I appreciate that about you and we can talk about it, but for now we really have to leave the house.” (Page 140)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Most “bad behavior” is caused by • acting out of feelings. • testing your boundaries and their limits. • curiosity: your child thinking, “What happens if I do this?” • your child not being appropriately challenged and therefore becoming challenging. (Page 143)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Your average three-year-old is wildly different from just a year ago. With individuation, he is fumbling to find out how he is separate from you. He is entering deep play, which often looks like not listening. He is gaining mastery over his physical abilities and really needs to test the limits of what his little body can do. He doesn’t want to be a baby anymore but he still needs a lot of help. He doesn’t want to be told what to do, yet he still needs direction. (Page 145)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Bad child versus bad behavior. It’s important to distinguish “you’re so bad” from “your behavior is very bad right now.” When you call a child bad, psychologically this can be interpreted as the child himself is bad, which can lead to a core belief that will damage the child. (Page 146)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You’ll find she’ll develop critical thinking, executive functioning skills, and excellent risk assessment if you ease up on the “Be careful!” (Page 147)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Does it matter if your child has learned to read but can’t zipper his own coat? • Does it matter if your child got into Harvard and doesn’t know how to scramble an egg? (Page 150)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>That chaotic behavior, that contrary, grumpy no to everything you say: that is your little one saying, “I want to figure this out. I want to be my own person.” (Page 152)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“Children are far more capable than we allow them to be.” (Page 153)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>His teacher looked at me and said dryly, “Go nuts. Buy a case of Scotch tape. How much do you spend on toys?” Oof. Shot to the heart, right? (Page 154)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Think basic life skills at this age. (Page 155)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Giving responsibility is what builds self-esteem, not saying “good job, buddy” a thousand times. (Page 155)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Getting dressed. At three years old and definitely by four, your child should be able to dress himself. (Page 155)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Pouring a drink. They are fully capable of pouring liquids into glasses. This sometimes requires your putting fluids in a smaller, more manageable container; a gallon of milk is obviously too much, so you can pour milk into a two-cup spouted measuring cup. (Page 155)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Light chores. Most kids adore cleaning the toilet. I know. Weird, right? Let them! Light vacuuming, making beds, folding laundry (badly, but still), putting their clothes away, filling their own water bottles are just a few ideas. (Page 156)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>children are within the center of your home and life, they feel loved and safe. When we make them the center of the home and life, things get off-kilter. (Page 156)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Our guiding question should be “What can our children do for themselves?” This approach takes practice, so be patient with yourself and your child. Reframing the whole day into life skills instead of education and scheduled activities can change everything for the whole family. (Page 160)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>All you need to do is think, How can I teach her to do more on her own? How can I let her be more independent? (Page 160)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Think engagement and connection, rather than educational content. (Page 2370269)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>they blow me away with their thinking because they don’t have a preconceived notion of what or how anything should be. (Page 2373032)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>As a culture we are obsessed with production and performance. We want quantifiable results; we love having something to show for our work. This is fine and acceptable in some circumstances, but with our kids, it’s not the way to foster growth and independence. While following exact directions so everyone gets the same results is useful at times, there are pockets in our lives where we want the opposite. (Page 2374936)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>That’s why we have art. To create and expand our inner and outer worlds. To use color and form and shape to express what words may not. (Page 2375443)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You may find yourself uttering the words “No, not like that, like this.” We become invested in the product, not the process. We become mistake monitors. Which puts a huge damper on the little minds working to make the little hands express something. (Page 2376023)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>First and foremost, you have to let go of the fear of mess. Real expression, true art, and letting go of control means there will be messes. Create space for that in your home. I promise the rewards will be greater than the mess.

Do you need help or do you want to stop for now?” (Page 2380893)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Try to create an art space, a table, a corner—a place where the supplies can be left out. (Page 2381112)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Rather than guessing what it is (and being woefully wrong), ask instead, “Can you tell me about it?” (Page 2382594)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>For three-dimensional creations, including Lego structures and box forts, take pictures. Make a photo book (Page 2383885)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>This is the problem with merchandised toys that are modeled after characters from movies and shows. You child will play within the construct of those characters (Page 2385341)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>As a general culture, we limit risk assessment, thinking our little ones are too little to be trying something risky. (Page 2395993)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We also don’t let our kids hash out emotions and social conflict. We tend to “break it up” super fast. This is denying our kids something they need, and again, it can come back to kick you in the ass. (Page 2397410)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Children who get lots of Big Play end up sitting still better when it’s time to sit. They listen better. They don’t fidget as much and get so wiggly and obnoxious and annoying. (Page 2399638)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A quick note about organized sports. They are not the same as Big Play because they are adult-led and structured, although they tend to use the same muscle groups. (Page 2406717)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>It leads to taking risks, because really, how can test your own engine if you’re not taking it to the edge? (Page 2407268)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>But there’s another thing we’ve been sort of hoodwinked into believing, and that is that our kids should never get hurt. That you are a bad parent if your child gets hurt. (Page 2408450)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Risk inherently comes with failure. I’m extrapolating into the later years and larger life because there’s no magical older age when you belatedly learn it’s okay to take a risk and it’s okay to fail. (Page 2409710)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Self-esteem is not built on careful. (Page 2411108)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Try moving … your feet slowly, carefully, quickly, strongly.\nTry using your … hands, feet, arms, legs.

(Page 2416532)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Kids who feel in control of their body, time, and life are less likely to suffer from anxiety and depression in later years. (Page 2418696)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Like they have sleeping windows, kids have eating windows. (Page 2431136)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Is a sit-down family meal more important at this point in your child’s life or is good sleep? You most likely cannot have both (Page 2432195)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>But if you are getting crappy behavior around bedtime, it’s almost always because it’s too late. And if you’re getting crappy behavior at dinner, it’s also probably too late. (Page 2432473)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A good loose rule is that when you find the right window, your little one will go to sleep almost immediately. And your child will sleep longer. (Page 2436610)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If you are struggling with sleep issues, you should move bedtimes earlier and earlier by fifteen-minute increments. (Page 2436895)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Hug her and cuddle her and tell her everything is going to be okay. Keep the comforting confined to her room, so that she knows her sleep environment is safe and secure. (Page 2440836)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Bedtime is the perfect time to build attachment and open communication about what’s going on in their lives.\nTry a lot of open-ended questions and ask them while you’re doing certain activities together, like coloring. (Page 2443259)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Make yoga a part of your bedtime routine! This is a great way for kids to relax, reduce stimulation, and quiet their minds.

Not: to agree with, to be right. (Page 2446024)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We don’t give our kids nearly the same courtesy as we give other, bigger humans. Like, if you are boiling hot and I’m freezing cold, you would not tell me, “No, you’re not. It’s so hot. You’re not cold.” (Page 2446523)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Our little ones have a lot of feelings, often colliding into each other in their own brains, never mind with you and the outside world. (Page 2447153)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We tend to focus on the negative, but we should also acknowledge joy and happiness and the more positive emotions. We tend to gloss over those. (Page 2448019)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The ultimate respect is knowing that we aren’t in our children’s bodies. We don’t know if they are really hungry or not. Right? (Page 2448779)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Please notice some very specific language here: Yes and. That’s validation. When we use the words Yes but, we almost instantly invalidate. (Page 2449169)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Wearing shorts in a snowstorm is most likely going to produce a whining toddler within minutes. Let them decide and cover your bases with just-in-case clothes. A yes and a yes.\n“I know you are not cold right now. See the snow outside? It’s cold. Let’s put some pants in the bag just in case you do get cold.” Validate and cover your parental ass.

I know you’re not tired and it’s time for bed.” (Page 2452233)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If you say, “Yes, you are tired,” you know the response that is almost guaranteed, right? “No, I’m not!” Now you just entered yourself in a power struggle with a tired toddler. (Page 2452449)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>In the toy-swiping scenario, this might look like, “I can see you are really angry. I would be angry as well. Let’s take a minute and think about what we can do about it.” (Page 2454648)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>What I normally see play out is the child having a big emotion, justified or not, and parents rushing in to save the child and fix the situation. Listen, there will always be a bully, there will always be a jerk. (Page 2454825)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You don’t have to make eighteen pieces of toast to see which cut will suit your child. In fact, it’s not helpful. First off, you’re completely setting up your child to expect you to fix everything. Second, you’re not allowing the actual feeling. You’re unconsciously saying, Don’t feel that. Here. I’ll hurry up and fix it so you’re not feeling the thing. (Page 2455534)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“I can see this has made you very angry. Why don’t you take a minute to settle and then we’ll figure out what to do.” I’m using “settle” instead of “calm down” because never in the history of the world have the words calm down made a human calm down. (Page 2455995)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>but instead of directly addressing the toy stealing, you first address your child’s fury. “Wow, you’re so angry and I understand why. Let’s go over here for a minute and settle your body and we’ll figure out what to do.” (Page 2457484)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can even lean into the feeling. “You are so angry. That was very unfair.” Let your little one vent. Too often we try to hurry up and fix the anger or frustration. It’s okay to let them really feel it. Yes! That sucked! (Page 2457846)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>There is more societal judgment about discipline than any other area of parenting. (Page 2459231)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Punishment is a power dynamic, backed by a notion of “paying for what you did.” The child does something you deem bad and you will make that child “pay for it.” Punishment can seem arbitrary to the child. Punishment can feel like it comes out of the blue, with no warning. The child does something and punishment swoops in. (Page 2460627)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The natural consequence feels severe, so we put in an external consequence. You don’t want your child to potentially crack open her head, so you institute something external, like a time-out. The problem is, in most cases, the child makes zero connection between the wrongdoing and the punishment. (Page 2461462)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“My child isn’t giving me a hard time. My child is having a hard time.” (Page 2463553)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If your child has done something that makes your rage boil, chances are your little one hit a trigger point for you. This is the time to remove yourself. Maybe it means leaving the room. Or hiding out in the parental office, otherwise known as the bathroom. (Page 2466143)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can be very clear with your words: “When you do (x-y-z), I get crazy mad. I’m going to take a break so I can calm down before I talk with you.” Or even a shortened version of “Argh. I’m so angry I need a break. I will be right back.” (Page 2466569)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Ownership of your own anger. Not “you made me feel.” (Page 2466849)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You are going to take a break; when we feel that sudden onset of anger, we tend to say shit that is useless, ineffective, or mean. Taking a break to calm down is always key.\n• The last thing to notice is “I’ll be back.” I’m not abandoning you or the situation. I just need a little time. (Page 2466907)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>But there’s extreme power in doing the opposite. Whispering makes the child have to stop to hear you. Right there, you’ve disrupted the escalation. Whispering is also 100 percent less threatening than yelling. (Page 2467402)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Being yelled at sucks in any circumstance. But in front of anyone else, including siblings and family members, getting yelled at is public humiliation. (Page 2467792)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>When you put your heads literally together to whisper in her ear, you become a team. The child is not left alone with a yucky feeling. (Page 2468669)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can be super effective when you’re looking your little one in the eye, on his level. Kneel down in front of him so you are eye to eye. (Page 2468989)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Offer your child a break with or without you. Give him specifics on his behavior. “It looks like you’re having a hard time controlling your body. You need a break. Do you want me to come with you or do you want to be by yourself?” (Page 2470471)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Tight bear hugs can actually physically calm a child down. Putting pressure on the skin calms the body. (Page 2470936)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I suggest weighted blankets to help them self-regulate. (Page 2471088)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“When I’m frustrated, I like to go outside and yell it out.” Or “I like to go throw pillows in my room. Would you like to try that?” (Page 2472102)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Whenever they’re possible, I’m a huge fan of natural consequences. In many instances, that simply means leaving. Leaving the party, the store, the park, the friend’s house. If your child is displaying angry, frustrated, or aggressive behavior, oftentimes it means you should leave. (Page 2472333)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Three more chances and counting to three are completely ineffective if you don’t actually follow through (Page 2474896)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Sometimes that means leaving a full cart of groceries.

components are back on the hot seat. Ryan Carniato set the space on fire with his post [Web Components are Not the Future](https://dev.to/ryansolid/maybe-web-components-are-not-the-future-hfh), and the subsequent discussion has been spicy. I'm not going to counter or analyze the points he makes in that article, Nolan Lawson does that better than I could in his response, [Web Components Are Okay](https://nolanlawson.com/2024/09/28/web-components-are-okay/). Instead, I will expand upon Nolan's points in his excellent post, [Use Web Components For What They're Good At](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/) to show that Web Components are critical to the future of the web.\n## Why Do I Need a Framework to Build a Web Page?\n\nIn 1996, I was 7 years old, and I built a Dragonball Z fan page in plain old HTML. I wrote it using Notepad in a single file. In high school and college, I built more interesting sites with CSS and jQuery, all in a simple folder. The web had evolved but still made intuitive sense to me. Then I graduated and got a job doing KnockoutJS and Angular, and it was as if I'd jumped from arithmetic to calculus. Node? NPM? Package versions? Bundlers? Compilers? I needed exponentially more knowledge than ever just to run the website.\n\nWeb Components offer developers the opportunity to develop for the web itself and extend HTML to bring new and complex functionality into tags that a 7-year-old could understand and use.\n## Prove it\n\nAt Amazon, I helped create a collection of Web Components called [Crowd HTML Elements](https://blog.mturk.com/mturk-introduces-crowd-html-elements-a-library-of-easy-to-use-task-interfaces-for-bounding-box-35bb9c860069) to empower non-technical users to create complex annotation interfaces for machine learning training. [This](https://codepen.io/sagemaker_crowd_html_elements/pen/XWpJGad) is a Codepen of a full image annotation application built using Crowd HTML Elements. There is no JavaScript or CSS in the Codepen, just an HTML file which looks like this:\n\n```html\n\u003Cscript src=\"https://assets.crowd.aws/crowd-html-elements.js\">\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Ccrowd-form>\n  \u003Ccrowd-bounding-box\n\tname=\"annotatedResult\"\n    src=\"{{ImageUrl}}\"\n    header=\"Draw bounding boxes around all the cats and dogs in this image\"\n    labels=\"['Fish', 'Coral', 'Turtle']\"\n  >\n    \u003Cfull-instructions header=\"Bounding Box Instructions\" >\n      \u003Cp>Use the bounding box tool to draw boxes\u003C/p>\n      \u003Col>\n        \u003Cli>More instructions go here\u003C/li>\n      \u003C/ol>\n    \u003C/full-instructions>\n\n    \u003Cshort-instructions>\n      Draw boxes around the requested target of interest.\n    \u003C/short-instructions>\n  \u003C/crowd-bounding-box>\n\u003C/crowd-form>  \n```\nWhich renders an entire application that looks like this:\n![Crowd-bounding-box application](./pasted-image-20241101135839.png)\n\nThe `\u003Ccrowd-bounding-box>` component encapsulates the complexity of working with a `\u003Ccanvas>` element and surfaces an application that is dead simple to configure for anyone. \n\nComponents like this are also hackable with minimal coding knowledge. [This link](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-task-uis/blob/master/images/bounding-box-custom-labels.liquid.html) demonstrates how a user could enhance `\u003Ccrowd-bounding-box>` to let end-users dynamically add and edit labels. This creation and hacking requires no node or NPM, bundlers, compilers, or transpilers, just a `\u003Cscript>` tag. A similar modification to a React component is challenging in comparison.\n\nCrowd HTML Elements has helped tens of thousands of users create hundreds of thousands of complex applications without needing extensive coding knowledge. For them, creating similar applications using a modern framework would be impossible.\n## What Could the Future Look Like?\n\nThe previous \"bounding box\" example is quite basic compared to what is possible. Utilizing web components with carefully designed APIs allows us to develop self-assembling applications of limitless complexity that are easily extendable by anyone with an extra script tag. Let's take a moment to envision an online image editor built on web components using some ideal code.\n\n```html\n\u003Cscript src=\"developer-A.com/open-app-layout.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript src=\"developer-B.com/image-editor-core.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript src=\"developer-C.com/image-toolset-painting.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript src=\"developer-D.com/image-toolset-hue-saturation.js\">\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript src=\"my-custom-gradient-tool.js\">\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Copen-app-layout left-drawer-open>\n\t\u003Cimage-editor-core id=\"editor\" slot=\"main\" />\n\t\u003Cimage-editor-tooldrawer slot=\"left-drawer\">\n\t\t\u003Cpainting-tools colors=\"[whatever you want]\" />\n\t\t\u003Chue-sat-tools />\n\t\t\u003Cmy-custom-gradient-tool />\n\t\u003Cimage-editor-tooldrawer>\n\u003C/open-app-layout>\n```\n\nIn this dream, a `\u003Copen-app-layout>` component provides a configurable, responsive layout. Slotted into the layout is a `\u003Ceditor-core>` component that encapsulates a `\u003Ccanvas>`, provides loading/saving functionality, and surfaces an interface for tools to connect. Finally, we have three chosen toolsets, `\u003Cpainting-tools>` and `\u003Chue-sat-tools>` from external developers, and `\u003Cmy-custom-gradient-tool>,` which is something we have built ourselves to add functionality.\n\nThis hypothetical HTML file integrates components made by five developers, including ourselves, into a fully functional image editor. These components could have been built years apart using different frameworks or versions and work together seamlessly forever.\n## Conclusion\n\nMost developers think about web applications through the lens of compiled frameworks like React. Packages and components are imported, woven together, and then distributed as a complete application. There's little reason to bother with Web Components in this paradigm when framework native component libraries are available. This view is one-dimensional and ignores the most compelling aspects of Web Components. \n\nThe internet is for everyone. It's ever-expanding, everlasting, and ever backward-compatible. It needs a specification so people who care can extend the foundational HTML it's built on. That specification is Web Components. For us developers, a wider HTML foundation means we can build complex applications more quickly using proven pre-fabricated pieces. For everyone else, building cool things on the web should be for more than just companies and developers; we need to lower that bar, or the internet may become a [lifeless husk](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest).","src/content/garden/Web Components Are Important.md",[1412],"./pasted-image-20241101135839.png","ffe1a95552f37651",{"html":1415,"metadata":1416},"\u003Ch1 id=\"web-components-are-important\">Web Components Are Important\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"expanding-the-foundation-of-the-web\">\u003Cem>Expanding the Foundation of the Web\u003C/em>\u003C/h4>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Web components are back on the hot seat.

Slotted into the layout is a \u003Ccode>&#x3C;editor-core>\u003C/code> component that encapsulates a \u003Ccode>&#x3C;canvas>\u003C/code>, provides loading/saving functionality, and surfaces an interface for tools to connect. Finally, we have three chosen toolsets, \u003Ccode>&#x3C;painting-tools>\u003C/code> and \u003Ccode>&#x3C;hue-sat-tools>\u003C/code> from external developers, and \u003Ccode>&#x3C;my-custom-gradient-tool>,\u003C/code> which is something we have built ourselves to add functionality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This hypothetical HTML file integrates components made by five developers, including ourselves, into a fully functional image editor. These components could have been built years apart using different frameworks or versions and work together seamlessly forever.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Most developers think about web applications through the lens of compiled frameworks like React. Packages and components are imported, woven together, and then distributed as a complete application. There’s little reason to bother with Web Components in this paradigm when framework native component libraries are available. This view is one-dimensional and ignores the most compelling aspects of Web Components.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The internet is for everyone. It’s ever-expanding, everlasting, and ever backward-compatible. It needs a specification so people who care can extend the foundational HTML it’s built on. That specification is Web Components. For us developers, a wider HTML foundation means we can build complex applications more quickly using proven pre-fabricated pieces. For everyone else, building cool things on the web should be for more than just companies and developers; we need to lower that bar, or the internet may become a \u003Ca href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest\">lifeless husk\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>",{"headings":1417,"localImagePaths":1435,"remoteImagePaths":1436,"frontmatter":1437,"imagePaths":1440},[1418,1420,1423,1426,1429,1432],{"depth":27,"slug":1419,"text":1402},"web-components-are-important",{"depth":70,"slug":1421,"text":1422},"expanding-the-foundation-of-the-web","Expanding the Foundation of the Web",{"depth":104,"slug":1424,"text":1425},"why-do-i-need-a-framework-to-build-a-web-page","Why Do I Need a Framework to Build a Web Page?",{"depth":104,"slug":1427,"text":1428},"prove-it","Prove it",{"depth":104,"slug":1430,"text":1431},"what-could-the-future-look-like","What Could the Future Look Like?",{"depth":104,"slug":1433,"text":1434},"conclusion","Conclusion",[1412],[],{"planted":1438,"stage":144,"publish":57,"title":1405,"note-type":1408,"modified":1439},["Date","2024-10-27T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2024-11-02T05:06:31.000Z"],[1412]]
